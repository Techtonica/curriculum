### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

While hackathons are valuable and exciting events, there are some common mistakes and misconceptions that participants may have. Here are a few to be aware of:

- Focusing too much on winning: While winning a hackathon can be rewarding, it's important not to lose sight of the primary goals: learning, collaboration, and innovation.
- Underestimating the importance of teamwork: Hackathons often involve teamwork and collaboration. Some participants make the mistake of trying to do everything on their own, which can lead to burnout, missed opportunities for learning, and suboptimal outcomes.
- Overlooking planning and time management: Time is usually limited during a hackathon, so it's crucial to plan and manage your time effectively.
