# Socioeconomic-differences

### Projected Time
Total - 1 hour
Lesson - 23 minutes
Check for Understanding - 30-40 minutes


### Prerequisites

  None

### Motivation

A person's socioeconomic status can inform their identity, as it affects the community around them and their lived experiences. Therefore, there are some shared experiences among people who come from blue-collar backgrounds and move to white-collar jobs. The experience can be unsettling, and feel alienating at times, as it might be hard to understand a different workplace environment, and experience potentially negative responses from people around them. The purpose of covering this topic is to help people recognize what might cause those feelings, and be able to address them when they arise.

### Objectives
Participants will be able to:

- Anticipate certain pitfalls and aversions that come with belonging to a certain socioeconomic class
- Learn the value of social capital and importance of asking for help from their fellow colleagues and seniors.
- Learn that it’s normal for white-collar professionals to want reasons behind tasks and therefore one must not panic but rather give an appropriate reason for the decision.


### Specific Things to Learn
   
   - The term "class straddler"
   - The value of social capital
   - The priority of networking

### Lesson (approx 23 minutes)

1. Research about the term "Class Straddler."

2. Explain each of the following points in brief:
  - Amidst their transformation journey (from blue-collar job to white-collar job), participants may struggle with white-collar tacts such as:
	    - They may often feel out of place.
        - They may overwork themselves in order to "fit in" amongst their workspace.
	    - Civil discussions about problems and solutions may feel like arguments.
	    - It can be hard to accept compliments.
	    - Their communities may scorn over their class straddling for it may be hard for them to accept the change   too.                   
	    - (Other problems can also be added as the discussion is continued.)
	   
      - The reasons why they may feel aloof or "out-of-place" are:
	       - Many such class straddlers support extended families as well.
	       - They have learned to live with isolation.
	       - They may not know the value of therapy.
	       - Generally people often dress, eat, and drink differently i.e. everybody has a different cultural and social background.
          - They have scorned the rich and their lifestyle but now they are part of that atmosphere and it’s hard not to judge themselves or feel guilty.
