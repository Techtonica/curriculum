# Socioeconomic-differences

### Projected Time
~30

### Prerequisites

None

### Motivation
A person's socioeconomic status can inform their identity, as it affects the community around them and their lived experiences. Therefore, there are some shared experiences among people who come from blue-collar backgrounds and move to white-collar jobs. The experience can be unsettling, and feel alienating at times, as it might be hard to understand a different workplace environment, and experience potentially negative responses from people around them. The purpose of this lesson is to help people recognize what might cause those feelings, and be able to address them when they arise.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Anticipate certain pitfalls and aversions that come with belonging to a certain socioeconomic class

### Specific Things To Teach
- The term "class straddler"
- The value of social capital
- The priority of networking

### Materials

- Limbo: Blue-Collar Roots, White-Collar Dreams by Alfred Lubrano
- Hidden Rules of Class at Work by Ruby K. Payne and Don L. Krabill
- Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance
- [Example video (10 min)](https://example.com) - Write a very short description of this resource.
- [Other example article(20 min read)](https://otherexample.com) - Answer the 3 questions at the end.
(Be sure to explain how to use these materials in directions in one of the sections below (ie: lesson, guided practice).  If you are not assigning them somehow, they should be placed under Supplemental Materials at the bottom.) 

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

- [Be sure to link the slideshow, video,](google.com)
- [or other materials you expect them to follow as part of the lesson.](google.com)

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

- Example
- Example


### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step.  This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it's less guided, more independent.

### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they've learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps them self-assess their understanding. This exercise should help apprentices determine whether they've met the outline objectives, or if they need to review.
