## üë≠ Collaborative Framework

This guide is written from the perspective of job seeking as an individual, but research has proven that forming a supportive group of support can enhance the experience. Here are some guidelines for forming and maintaining effective job-seeking groups:

1. **Establish Clear Expectations**: Create a shared document outlining group norms and commitments (i.e. [communication agreement](https://medium.com/@laidrivm/guide-why-and-how-to-implement-communication-agreement-e0803735e2c5#:~:text=On%20a%20team%20level%2C%20having,the%20resulting%20rules%20and%20recommendations.))
2. **Rotating Responsibilities**: Take turns leading daily stand-ups and other group activities
3. **Accountability System**: Implement check-ins and progress tracking for all members
4. **Skill Sharing**: Leverage each member's strengths through knowledge exchange sessions
5. **Collective Resources**: Maintain shared documents for job leads, company research, and interview experiences
6. **Regular Retrospectives**: Conduct weekly reviews to improve group processes
7. **Support Structure**: Create channels for both technical and emotional support
8. **Celebration Protocol**: Acknowledge and celebrate each member's wins and progress

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Self-Assessment**: Evaluate your current skills, goals, and job search readiness
2. **Resource Gathering**: Compile necessary tools, platforms, and learning materials
3. **Schedule Creation**: Adapt the daily schedule template to your personal circumstances
4. **Metrics Definition**:
   - Weekly application goals (minimum 5)
   - Networking outreach targets (minimum 2 tactics)
   - Code review commitments (minimum 2 per week)
   - Mock interview schedule (minimum 1 every two weeks)
5. **Accountability Setup**:
   - Find partners or form a group for mutual accountability
   - Set up a job search tracking spreadsheet
   - Establish a daily schedule that works for you
   - Find accountability partners (optional)
6. **Launch Plan**: Create a detailed plan for your first week of structured job seeking
