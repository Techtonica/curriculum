## Whiteboarding Interview Challenges

### Primary Goals

Demonstrate knowledge of how to approach a whiteboarding challenge.

### Overview

You will write simple JS functions based on verbal prompts, in a whiteboard setting. This will take about 60 minutes if you include setup and cleanup; there are 2 20-minute challenges.

Keep in mind that the goal is to exhibit whiteboarding steps you've learned. If you demonstrate that you know the process but don't complete the challenge perfectly at this point, that's okay.

### Languages

- JavaScript

### Tools

- A whiteboard or presentation paper, and markers
- A timer

## Project Instructions

#### Setup Instructions

- You will be assigned a partner. You will swap roles as interviewer and interviewee.
- A whiteboard or presentation paper will feel the most like a real interview, especially if the interviewee is standing. If you don't have these, a piece of paper and a pencil will work.
- Use a timer to make each interview 20 minutes long.
- The interviewer should observe, ask the interviewee why they are making certain choices, and ask leading questions if the interviewer gets stuck.
- Neither partner should read the prompt until that part of the challenge has begun.

### Part 1 - Mock Interview

- Once all of your materials are ready and you start the 20 minute timer, the interviewer should read [this code challenge](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alodahl/f269d17027633387c6b5c04fdf8dd0b3/raw/1c841e1fc563dc88b713e5723c58e145a685879b/Part%2520I,%2520question%25201) aloud to the interviewee. (Neither person can peek until the actual interview!)
- Be sure to write down your thoughts as well as code to demonstrate that you understood the whiteboarding topic.

### Part 2 - After 20 minutes:**

- Take a photo of your code before moving on.
- Partners should now switch roles. Set the timer for another 20 minutes, and the new interviewer should read [this code challenge](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alodahl/2f86ed0e231baf13be8c524352b34139/raw/18935fcd8bf5b0a1da030b68e94ed3a72e11bf29/Part%2520I,%2520question%25202) aloud to the interviewee.

### Part 3 - Submit your code

- Submit the photo of your own practice with the names of your partners.
