   - What matters most to you in a workplace?
   - Which causes or missions resonate with you?
   - What kind of impact do you want your work to have?

4. **Explore Different Tech Domains**

   - Frontend development (user interfaces, design systems)
   - Backend development (APIs, databases, server architecture)
   - DevOps (infrastructure, deployment, monitoring)
   - Security (protecting systems and data)
   - Data science (analysis, machine learning)
   - Product management (feature planning, user research)

5. **Investigate Industry Sectors**

   - Healthcare tech
   - Financial technology
   - Education technology
   - E-commerce
   - Enterprise software

## Activities

### 🧘🏾 Activity 1: Career Orientation Self-Assessment

Understanding your current career orientation helps identify appropriate next steps in your journey to becoming a full stack software engineer.

1. Assess your current level of career awareness (Do you know where you want to go?)
2. Evaluate your current level of career satisfaction (Are you happy with your current situation?)
3. Identify which quadrant best describes your current state
4. Review the recommended next steps for your quadrant
5. Use this insight to inform your career exploration activities

#### How to Apply This to Your Career Transition

Your current career orientation isn't fixed—it's a snapshot of where you are right now. As you develop new skills, gain clarity about your goals, and take steps toward your desired career, your orientation will shift.

For career changers moving into full stack software engineering, this framework helps you:

- Acknowledge your starting point without judgment
- Identify whether you need to focus on building awareness, satisfaction, or both
- Choose appropriate next steps based on your current orientation
- Track your progress as you move through different quadrants
  Remember that many successful software engineers started in the "Disoriented" or "Shifting" quadrants. With intentional exploration and skill development, you can move toward a "Purposeful" orientation in your new career.

- What specific actions will you take in the next month to explore your career interests further?
- How might your background and unique experiences provide value in a technology role?

**Reality**: Career exploration is iterative—taking small steps and adjusting based on feedback is often more effective than waiting for perfect clarity.

## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **Misconception: "I need to know exactly what I want to do before starting my tech career."**
  Reality: Many successful tech professionals discover their niche after trying different roles. It's okay to start with exploration and refine your path as you gain experience.
- **Misconception: "My previous career experience isn't relevant to tech."**
  Reality: Non-technical skills and domain knowledge from previous careers often provide unique value and perspective in tech roles.
- **Misconception: "I'm too old/young to change careers into tech."**
  Reality: The tech industry includes professionals who entered at various life stages. Your unique perspective and life experience can be valuable assets.
- **Misconception: "I need to be passionate about coding 24/7 to succeed in tech."**
  Reality: While enthusiasm helps, sustainable careers are built on finding meaningful work that aligns with your values, not constant passion.
- **Misconception: "I should choose the highest-paying specialization regardless of my interests."**
  Reality: Career satisfaction depends more on alignment with your motivations than compensation alone. Pursuing areas that genuinely interest you leads to better long-term outcomes.
- **Misconception: "Once I choose a tech specialization, I'm locked into that path."**
  Reality: Tech careers are increasingly fluid, with many professionals pivoting between specializations as their interests evolve and new opportunities emerge.
