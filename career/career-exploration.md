## Career Exploration: Empowering Career Changers

### Objectives

- Recognize that aligning work with personal interests is a human right, not a privilege
- Identify personal career motivations and orientations
- Develop a clear understanding of long-term career goals and immediate next steps
- Create an actionable plan for transitioning into full stack software engineering
- Utilize the Skills Matrix tool to map current skills and identify growth areas

### Motivation and Real-World Application

Many individuals from underrepresented backgrounds or lower socioeconomic status view the intersection of work and personal interests as a luxury rather than an attainable goal. This perspective can limit career exploration and advancement. However, finding fulfillment in your work is not a privilege—it's a fundamental aspect of professional development that everyone deserves to pursue.

Full stack software engineering offers diverse pathways that can align with various career motivations:

- **Security & Stability** can find reliable employment in established tech companies
- **Pure Challenge** can tackle complex technical problems
- **Service/Dedication to a Cause** can work on applications that create social impact
- **Lifestyle** can find remote or flexible work arrangements
- **Autonomy & Independence** can freelance or work in self-directed teams

## Activities

### 🧘🏾 Activity 1: Career Orientation Self-Assessment
Understanding your current career orientation helps identify appropriate next steps in your journey to becoming a full stack software engineer.
1. Assess your current level of career awareness (Do you know where you want to go?)
2. Evaluate your current level of career satisfaction (Are you happy with your current situation?)
3. Identify which quadrant best describes your current state
4. Review the recommended next steps for your quadrant
5. Use this insight to inform your career exploration activities

#### How to Apply This to Your Career Transition
Your current career orientation isn't fixed—it's a snapshot of where you are right now. As you develop new skills, gain clarity about your goals, and take steps toward your desired career, your orientation will shift.

For career changers moving into full stack software engineering, this framework helps you:
- Acknowledge your starting point without judgment
- Identify whether you need to focus on building awareness, satisfaction, or both
- Choose appropriate next steps based on your current orientation
- Track your progress as you move through different quadrants
Remember that many successful software engineers started in the "Disoriented" or "Shifting" quadrants. With intentional exploration and skill development, you can move toward a "Purposeful" orientation in your new career.

### 📊 Activity 2: Skills Matrix Mapping

Using the [Skills Matrix tool](https://daaimah123.github.io/skills_matrix/):
