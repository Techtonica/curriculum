### Common Mistakes & Misconceptions

List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

- LinkedIn Profile is a story of who you are becoming not everything you have been. It does not need to be a history of every job you have ever had. If you worked in retail for 7 years and now want a job as a software engineer then there is no need to include the retail experience in your LinkedIn profile. If you do then it will hurt you in search results done by a recruiter. For example a recruiter will do a search for "Software Engineer" "1-3 years" experience and you will not appear although you may have 1 year of experience. You will appear in the search for "Software Engineer" "8-10 years" because LinkedIn counts years of work experience not specific to your title.

- LinkedIn is Not Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Only post and comment on things that represent you as an employee. Keep a strict line bewteen professional and personal. For example I can post on LinkedIn that I am going to a Women in Tech dinner or maybe reading a book about bias in the workplace. If I am going to a political march on human rights then unless I am doing that as a organized sponsored company event I keep that to my Facebook page.

### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step. This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.

### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it's less guided, more independent.

### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they've learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.

### Check for Understanding

Review 10 profiles of people with similar expereince level and think how they could improve their profile and see if that applies to you too.
