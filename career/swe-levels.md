## Industry Variations

It's important to note that SWE levels can vary significantly between companies:

- **Big Tech Companies** (Google, Meta, Amazon) often have more granular levels (e.g., SWE I, SWE II, Senior SWE, Staff SWE, Principal SWE, Distinguished Engineer)
- **Startups** may have flatter structures with fewer formal levels
- **Enterprise Companies** might emphasize different skills at each level based on their specific domain

When evaluating job opportunities, always clarify the expectations and scope of each level at that specific company.

## Transitioning Between Levels

Moving between levels typically requires:

1. **Demonstrating skills** at the next level consistently before promotion
2. **Seeking feedback** regularly from managers and senior colleagues
3. **Taking initiative** on projects that showcase next-level capabilities
4. **Building visibility** for your work across the organization
5. **Developing mentorship skills** as you advance

Most engineers should expect to spend 1-3 years at each level before advancing, though this varies based on individual performance and company growth.
