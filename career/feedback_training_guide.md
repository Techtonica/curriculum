## Assumptions and Reframing Feedback

### Assume Good Intentions

1. **Identify the Core Message**: Understand the essence of what is being communicated.
2. **Determine Actionable Steps**: Think about how you can improve based on the feedback.

## Practical Examples of Feedback Reframing

### Example Feedback Statements

- **“You act like ungrateful royalty.”**

- **“You never listen to anyone.”**

  - **Takeaway**: Recognize the need for better listening skills.
  - **Reframe**: "I value everyone's input. Can you share specific instances where I could improve?"

- **“You’re overly critical.”**

  - **Takeaway**: Acknowledge that your criticism might be impacting others negatively.
  - **Reframe**: "I want to support my team better. Can you provide examples of when I was overly critical?"

- **“You talk too much.”**

  - **Takeaway**: Understand the importance of brevity.
  - **Reframe**: "I want to be concise. How can I ensure I communicate more effectively?"

## Follow-Up After Feedback

If you take action based on feedback, follow up with the giver to show appreciation:

- “I read that book you recommended and am using the concepts learned every day! Thank you.”
- “I’m working to no longer say ‘I think’ so much, and it’s really helped with my confidence and how people perceive what I say.”

## One Secret to Receiving Great Feedback

### Ask Often!

Engage with colleagues regularly to seek constructive feedback.

#### How to Ask for Feedback

1. **Be Specific**: Focus on concrete aspects of your work.
2. **Use a Rating Scale**:
   - “Can you rate my question-asking on a scale from 1-10?”
   - Ask for suggestions on how to improve by a point.
3. **Behavior Categorization**:
   - **Start Doing**: "One behavior I could start doing..."
   - **Stop Doing**: "One behavior I could stop doing..."
   - **Keep Doing**: "One behavior I should keep doing..."

## Feedback Formula Practice

### Structure for Feedback

- **Factual Observation** (no opinions)
- **Impact**
- **Pause to Listen/Questions to Understand**
- **Request**

### Practical Scenarios

1. **Dax and Jackie**:

   - **Context**: Jackie appears disinterested during Dax's presentation.
   - **Dax’s Approach**: "I noticed you seemed distracted during my presentation (factual observation). It made me concerned that you might not support the design (impact). Can you share what was on your mind? (pause). I’d appreciate your thoughts on the design."

2. **Janet and Athena**:

   - **Context**: Janet arrives late and comments on Athena's early arrival.
   - **Feedback Formula for Janet**: "I noticed you seemed upset when I came in late (factual observation). It seemed to affect our morning collaboration (impact). Can I ask if you’re feeling overwhelmed? (pause). I’d like to understand your perspective."

3. **Athena’s Approach**: "I felt taken aback by your comment earlier (factual observation). It made me feel unappreciated during a busy morning (impact). What was your intent? (pause). I’d love to discuss how we can support each other better."

## More Practice Scenarios

1. **Coworker Talking Excessively**:

   - “I’ve noticed you stop by often to chat about non-work topics (factual observation). It’s been challenging for me to focus on my tasks (impact). Can we set specific times to catch up? (pause). I’d love to find a balance that works for both of us.”

2. **Boss Not Giving Deadlines**:

   - “I’ve noticed there haven’t been clear deadlines for our tasks (factual observation). This sometimes makes it challenging to prioritize my work (impact). Can we establish some timelines moving forward? (pause). I think it would help our team stay on track.”

3. **Video Off During Calls**:

   - “I’ve noticed your video is off during our one-on-one calls (factual observation). It makes it a bit uncomfortable for me to engage fully (impact). Is there a reason for that? (pause). I’d prefer if we both kept our videos on for better communication.”

4. **Colleague Calling You Lazy**:

   - “I heard that you mentioned to someone else that I was lazy (factual observation). That was hurtful and made me feel unsupported (impact). Can we discuss what led to that comment? (pause). I’d like to clear the air and understand your perspective.”

5. **Manager Cutting You Off**:

   - “I’ve noticed you tend to cut me off during meetings (factual observation). It makes it difficult for me to share my thoughts (impact). Can we work on ensuring everyone has a chance to speak? (pause). I believe this will improve our team discussions.”

6. **Mentor Not Responding**:

   - “I’ve noticed there’s been a delay in responses to my questions on Slack (factual observation). This makes me feel uncertain about seeking your guidance (impact). Is there a better way to reach you or a preferred timeframe for responses? (pause). I’d love to know how to communicate more effectively.”

7. **Boss Canceling One-on-Ones**:
   - “I’ve noticed that our one-on-ones have been frequently canceled (factual observation). It’s challenging for me to get feedback and grow professionally without regular check-ins (impact). Can we establish a more consistent schedule? (pause). I think it would really benefit my development.”
