# Penetration Tester

## Role Overview
Penetration Testers (also known as Ethical Hackers or Pen Testers) simulate cyber attacks on computer systems, networks, and applications to identify security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. They help organizations strengthen their security posture through controlled testing.

## Average Salary
$85,000 - $130,000

## Summary
Penetration Testers use the same techniques as malicious hackers, but with permission and for defensive purposes, to identify and help fix security weaknesses in an organization's systems.

## Core Responsibilities
* Planning and executing controlled cyber attacks on systems
* Identifying security vulnerabilities and weaknesses
* Exploiting vulnerabilities to demonstrate potential impact
* Documenting findings and creating detailed reports
* Providing recommendations for security improvements
* Performing post-remediation testing
* Staying current with hacking techniques and tools
* Conducting social engineering tests when authorized

## Required Skills

### Technical Skills
* Network security concepts
* Operating system internals (Windows, Linux)
* Web application security
* Programming and scripting (Python, Bash, PowerShell)
* Exploitation techniques and methodologies
* Vulnerability assessment tools
* Reverse engineering
* Knowledge of common security frameworks

### Soft Skills
* Ethical judgment
* Analytical thinking
* Detailed documentation
* Clear communication of technical concepts
* Problem-solving abilities
* Persistence and creativity
* Time management
* Presentation skills for reporting findings

## Tools & Technologies
* **Penetration Testing Frameworks:** Metasploit, Cobalt Strike
* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, Nexpose
* **Web Application Testing:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
* **Network Analysis:** Wireshark, Nmap, Netcat
* **Password Cracking:** Hashcat, John the Ripper
* **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux, Parrot OS
* **Wireless Testing:** Aircrack-ng, Kismet

## Career Path
**Entry Level:** Junior Penetration Tester - Assisting with assessments, learning tools and techniques, performing basic tests.

**Mid Level:** Penetration Tester - Leading assessments, exploiting complex vulnerabilities, writing comprehensive reports.

**Senior Level:** Senior Penetration Tester - Handling complex environments, developing custom exploits, mentoring junior testers.

**Leadership:** Lead Penetration Tester, Red Team Manager - Leading teams, designing complex scenarios, setting testing strategy.

## Day in the Life
A typical day for a Penetration Tester might include:

* Planning attack strategies for an authorized test
* Performing reconnaissance on target systems
* Scanning for vulnerabilities in applications or networks
* Exploiting discovered vulnerabilities to demonstrate impact
* Documenting findings with screenshots and evidence
* Writing detailed reports explaining vulnerabilities and recommendations
* Meeting with clients to explain findings
* Researching new attack techniques
* Keeping up with security news and vulnerability disclosures

## End of Day Objectives

- Be able to discuss offensive security roles and how they differ from defensive security roles.
- Be able to discuss how penetration testing relates to other security functions.
- Understand the ethical boundaries and legal considerations of security testing.
- Connect with security professionals and schedule time with a few people to learn about their roles.
- Consider what kinds of steps you'd like to take to build skills in ethical hacking.

## End of Day Questions

- How do offensive and defensive security roles work together?
- What is the difference between vulnerability assessment and penetration testing?
- What did you learn about penetration testing that was different from what you previously understood?
- What steps will you take over the next six months to build knowledge in ethical hacking?

## Related Roles
* **Security Analyst** - Focuses on defensive security monitoring and analysis
* **Red Team Operator** - Conducts more advanced, long-term simulated attacks
* **Bug Bounty Hunter** - Finds vulnerabilities in public bug bounty programs
* **Security Engineer** - Builds and maintains security systems
* **Application Security Engineer** - Specializes in securing software applications

## Is This Role Right for You?
**You might enjoy this role if you:**
* Like solving complex puzzles and finding creative solutions
* Enjoy learning about how systems work and can be broken
* Have strong ethical boundaries
* Like the challenge of breaking into secure systems (legally)
* Enjoy continuous learning about new technologies and vulnerabilities

**This might not be the role for you if you:**
* Are uncomfortable with the ethical responsibilities
* Dislike detailed documentation and report writing
* Prefer building systems rather than breaking them
* Struggle with communicating technical concepts to non-technical people
* Dislike the pressure of time-boxed testing engagements

## Common Misconceptions
* **"Penetration testing is just running automated tools"** - It requires significant manual testing and creative thinking.
* **"Penetration testers are hackers who got caught"** - Most are security professionals who chose an ethical career path.
* **"The goal is to break everything"** - The goal is to improve security by finding and helping fix vulnerabilities.
* **"You need to be a programming expert"** - While coding skills help, understanding security concepts is more important.
