# Data Science

### Projected Time

- About 1 hour

### Prerequisites

No Prerequisites.

### Motivation

_Data science is a sexy job. The salaries are high, the work is interesting, and thereâ€™s significant prestige that comes with the title._

A data scientist will:

- Analyze Data
- Clean Data using Pandas & Numpy - Gaining insights
- Build models on data

* **[Bill James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_James)** applied data analysis to baseball

  - Who are the top performers?
  - How can you best predict future performance?

* **[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)** uses data analysis to recommend movies.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Create a Jupyter Notebook to begin data analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understand the purpose and methods of cleaning data
- Understand the methods of analyzing a dataset

### Specific Things to Learn

- Accessing Jupyter Notebooks
- Importing libraries such as pandas and NumPy into Jupyter Notebooks
- Techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identifying missing or erroneous data for possible cleaning
- Using pandas and NumPy to analyze a dataset

### Materials

- [Pandas (10 min read)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
- [Numpy (20 min video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mpc9ukltVA)

### Lesson

**[Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)** is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.

**LifeCycle of Data Science**

- Tools like Pandas, Numpy, Hadoop, Spark etc
  comprise an important part of the data science toolbox.
  It is up to the data scientist to figure out which tool to use in different
  circumstances (as well as how to use the tool correctly) in order to solve analytically
  open-ended problems.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Access to More Data Translates to Higher Accuracy
- Data Science and Business Intelligence Are the Same
- You Must Have Access to Lots of Data

### Guided Practice

- [Free guided practice on Analytics Vidhya](https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/a-comprehensive-learning-path-to-become-a-data-scientist-in-2019)
- [Free guided practice on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)
- [Free guided practice on dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/)

### Independent Practice

- [Practice on Kaggle with a no-setup Jupyter Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Practice in Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)

### Check for Understanding

**Form small groups and discuss:**

- What are the advantages of using NumPy Array?
- What differentiates data science from other analytical fields (business intelligence, etc)?

- **Assignments:**
  - [EDA with Pandas on Google-Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LQzSDISFudcL6meC3NXFOIaCYqXjNH04)
