# Roles in Tech

### Prerequisites

- [Professionalism](../professionalism.md)

### Motivation

- Your education in full-stack web development is just the first step in your career journey. Just like going to medical school can prepare you to be a researcher in the lab, an oncologist treating seriously ill patients, or a pediatrician working with children, there are many different roles that you can pursue with your new education.
- As you think through the different options to pursue, consider your work style, your interests and other factors that can make a difference in your work environment. Do you like working with people? Consider a customer-facing role such as Customer Success or Sales Engineering. Do you enjoy travel? A solutions consultant may work for several different clients all over a geographic region over the course of a year. Are you motivated by social causes? Consider applying for developer roles at non-profits or other mission-driven organizations.
- This lesson presents a wide variety of jobs that can utilize the skills of a Techtonica graduate.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"Since I'm attending a software engineering program, the only job in tech I'll be able to get after this will be as a junior software engineer."** Programming skills are useful in a wide variety of jobs, not just software engineering jobs. Though we think Techtonica best prepares you for a job as a software engineer, your unique background may lend itself to find work in another field within the tech industry.
- **"If I take a non-software-engineering job after Techtonica I'll be a failure. I'll have let people down."** We will celebrate your successful career transition regardless of what role you take. Techtonica's overarching goal is to improve people's financial stability and career stability. If you take a job that helps you improve these areas of your life, we consider our goal achieved! We also know that some folks might complete the program and be inspired to do non-engineering work. As long as you're happy, we're happy.
- **"Techtonica guarantees me a job as a software engineer after I complete the program."** Though we do our best to match each graduate with a sponsor company by the end of the program, we don't guarantee this outcome. If we aren't able to match you to a sponsor company, we'll mentor you through your job search and do our best to help you land your first role in tech.
- **"The only employees at a tech company who really matter are the engineers."** Engineers do get a lot of attention but the engineering department is one of many, and every department is essential in a growing company. The marketing department makes sure the product that the engineers built gets out into the world and brings in revenue. The product management department makes sure good and useful products are being built by the engineers. The HR and recruiting departments make sure the best people are hired into the company and that they're treated well while they're there. It's a whole ecosystem, and every person in it has an important role to play.
