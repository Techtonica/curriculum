Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson:

[Reading & Writing Documentation](../../reading-and-writing-documentation/documentation.md)

### Motivation

- Being a technical writer allows you to be a first user of the application. If you like the experience of using something brand new and playing around with it, failing and improving it, you would love technical writing.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Learn excellent writing skills to be able to explain technical information clearly.
- Take complex,technical information and simplify it for colleagues and consumers who have nontechnical backgrounds.
- Think about a procedure or product in the way a person without technical experience would think about it.

### Specific Things to Learn

- Determine the needs of users of technical documentation.
- Ability to interact with SMEs (Subject Matter Experts).
- Standardize content across platforms and media.

### Materials and Lessons

Technical writers, also called _technical communicators_, prepare instruction manuals, how-to guide journal articles and other supporting documents to communicate complex and technical information more easily. They also develop, gather, and disseminate technical information through an organization's communications channels.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

_Here are some of the common mistakes Technical Writers do-_

- **Messy Structure** : Many technical documents confuse readers and fail to achieve their aims because they were not planned properly to begin with.
- **Poor punctuation** : All writers have a passing knowledge of the main set of punctuation marks. Very few, however, outside of professional authors and editors, have a thorough grasp of how each one works.
- **Too much abstraction** : People writing in a formal or semi-formal context often go overboard in an effort to make their prose sound proper and elevated.

_A few misconceptions regarding Technical Writing are as follows-_

- Technical writers simply write a user manual. It is called by various fancy names for different products
- Technical documentation is an insignificant part of product development.
- It is enough to document key features of the product. Small things, the users can figure out themselves.

### Independent Practice

_Here are few practical and independent ways to independently learn the skill of Technical Writing_

- Edit someone else's work.
- Write a style guide.
- Read other's technical writing attentively.

### Challenge

- Write your own blogs.
- Write publications for different organizations and authors.
