#### Job of Product Manager

1. User/market research and analysis
2. create a solid Product strategy
3. Learn to Prioritize and re-prioritize various work threads.
4. Create a product and feature roadmap.
5. Know how to make a product stable and scalable.
6. Communicate effectively with Designers, Customers, Engineers and clients.

#### Qualities of PM:

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Tool are important for a PM. But if a PM uses too many tools it will waste both time and efforts.
- Build a Product according to current situation, not future needs.
