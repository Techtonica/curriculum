<h2>Any One Can Learn DevOps</h2>
>People from different backgrounds can learn DevOps. Even a fresher with basic knowledge of Linux and one scripting language can learn DevOps.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Continuous Development
- Continuous Testing
- Configuration Management and Continuous Integration
- Continuous Monitoring

### Specific Things to Learn

- Writing specifications and documentation for the server-side features
- Management of continuous deployment and continuous integration (CI/CD)
- CI/CD script writing
- Performance assessment and monitoring

### Materials

Some Continuos Integration Tools are

- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is a tool to use either as a server for continuous integration or a continuous delivery hub that comes with lots of additional plugins to tweak continuous delivery workflow.
- [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)is the mature CI server, coming from the labs of the JetBrains company. JetBrains has established authority in the software development world, and developers all over the world use their tools like WebStorm and ReSharper.
- [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) is one of the oldest hosted solutions out there and it has won the trust of many people. Although it’s mostly known for the hosted solution, it offers the on-premise version too in a form of enterprise package.
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is another cloud alternative that comes from the company with the same name. CircleCI currently only supports GitHub and the list of supported languages includes Java, Ruby/Rails, Python, Node.js, PHP, Haskell, and Scala.

Some Continuos Delivery Tools are

- [JBoss](http://www.jboss.org/) owned by Red Hat is a web application server which is fully integrated in order to host JAVA driven applications (applications developed using Java EE platform).
- Apache [TOMCAT](http://tomcat.apache.org/), also referred as Tomcat server is developed by ASF (Apache Software Foundation). It includes the integration of various Java specifications like Java Servlet, Java EE, Java EL, Web socket, server pages, Java expressions etc. that build a pure environment for Java code to run.

Other DevOps Tools are

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)is an instrument that helps with packaging code into self-contained units, i.e. containers.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)is a Version Control System with a repository for source code management that enables working online and offline.

- [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/) is an infrastructure monitoring tool that presents analytics in visual reports
- [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) is an automated browser that allows QA teams to write scripts and test web products. It’s compatible with eight popular programming languages.

- _For better understanding of **DevOps** refer to this slide [Roles in Tech:DevOps](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GaoHCdvQ2UplDjapp2wG-VRsxlqtzFqIpOtIqvKNYOo/edit?usp=sharing)_

### Lesson

**_DevOps_** stands for development and operations. It’s a practice that aims at merging development, quality assurance, and operations (deployment and integration) into a single, continuous set of processes. This methodology is a natural extension for Agile and continuous delivery approaches.

For Better Understanding of _DevOps_ , one should do continuous unit testing after deploying it on a suitable platform.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

While many industry leaders have successfully deployed DevOps to achieve faster speed-to-market with higher quality software and a first-class customer experience, there continues to be some fundamental misconceptions about what DevOps really means.

- **DevOps is a set of automated tools.**
- **DevOps procedures change from project to project.**:
