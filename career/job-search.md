Keep track of where you've applied, the status of your applications, and any follow-up actions needed. Tools like **Trello**, **Notion**, or **Airtable** can help you organize your job search.

- **Application Tracker**: Use a spreadsheet to track the roles you’ve applied to, their deadlines, interview dates, and feedback received.

#### 7. **Prepare for Interviews**:

Research the company and role, practice common interview questions, and develop a list of questions to ask your interviewers. This shows that you are proactive and interested in the company.

- Use platforms like **LeetCode** or **HackerRank** for coding practice.
