## Common Misconceptions
-   Feedback has to be about something HUGE
	- Many assume that feedback should only be given for significant issues or mistakes. Regular feedback on everyday tasks and small achievements can also drive continuous improvement and build confidence.
-   Feedback has to be about mistakes
	- While addressing mistakes is a part of giving feedback, it's equally important to acknowledge what someone is doing right. Positive feedback reinforces good practices and behaviors
-   Feedback will cause resentment
	- If delivered thoughtfully and constructively, feedback does not lead to resentment. It's crucial to approach feedback with empathy, focusing on growth and solutions rather than blame. This approach helps build trust and fosters a supportive environment where feedback is viewed as a tool for development rather than criticism.
