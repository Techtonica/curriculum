# Intro to backend

### Brief intro

Backend development is the unsung hero of the web world. Almost every piece of data on every website or service -- your facebook profile picture, the weather report on weather.com, and google's search results -- is served from a computer running backend code.


### Motivation

Backend development -- essentially, the creation of APIs -- involves a number of technologies working together to show some data. This lesson will briefly introduce you to those technologies, each of which you will learn about in the following weeks. By understanding your roadmap, you will have a better sense of what to learn in order to build your first API. Additionally, understanding the basics of backend development will allow you to...

* Fill in your own knowledge gaps: By learning the generalities of backend development, you will be able to ask yourself questions about the technologies you use every day. (or the technologies used by a company you're applying to!)
* Debug frontend code: while working on the frontend, the backend can sometimes seem a complete mystery. In this lesson we will show that the backend is much more simple than it is generally assumed to be, and this will allow you to work with backends you didn't write. (trust me, you will be doing this no matter what kind of position you get)

### Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will know the pieces that make up backend development. You won't know how they work yet, (the details are exciting, and we'll get to them later!) but you will be able to describe the functions of backend development and how it relates to API work. (Hint: they're basically the same thing) Specifically at the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Answer the age-old question: what is an API?
* Describe, step-by-step, how data flows from a database through a backend server and to the user.
    * Additionally, you should know of one technology involved in each step.
* Create a checklist of the technologies you need to learn in order to create a simple API

### Specific things to learn

* What does an API do?
* What is an API framework? Are API frameworks language-specific or language agnostic?
* What are some popular backend languages?
* What does a web server do? Can you name a few?
* What does a database do? Can you name the two different types of databases?

### Topics to learn & facilitate

* Why would someone choose one programming language over another for writing backend code?
* Why would there be so many frameworks for writing APIs?

### Common mistakes/misconceptions

* Some people think backend development is "harder" or "more technical" than frontend. This is silly: backend and frontend just require different skillsets. While you are learning, try thinking about whether backend or frontend better matches your preferences and established skills.
* Some people believe some backend technologies and frameworks are superior to others. This is also false. (there's a theme developing here) Some frameworks are built for simplicity, meaning you can get started with them easily. Others are built for robustness, meaning they will have pre-baked solutions to many common problems backend developers face. All of them have interesting pieces, and all of them are worth experimenting with.

### Guided practice


### Challenge
* I'm starting a new API company, and I need you to come up with a tech stack for me! Present each piece of the backend tech stack, and explain why you think I should use each technology! Remember: I'm running the company, but I don't know how any of this stuff works.
* Update the API you created in the lesson materials to allow the user to enter their name. When they do, the API should print out "Hello [name]!" instead of "Hello world!". (Look up query parameters in express)

### Check for understanding
* Get in small groups and quiz one another on your tech stacks. You should be able to name a technology you chose, and someone else should be able to tell you whether it is a...
    * Language
    * Framework
    * Database engine
    * Web server
