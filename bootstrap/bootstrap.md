# Bootstrap

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites
"CSS" lesson

### Motivation
Boostrap is a popular and easy-to-use front-end framework first released by Twitter.  Utilizing Bootstrap significantly reduces the amount of time spent styling your webpages, especially for mobile-development.  

### Objective
**Students will be able to** 
- Create a responsive layout using Bootstrap
- Design a website using the 12-column Grid system
- Inspect an HTML's box model using browser's developer tools

### Specific Things To Teach
- How to link Bootstrap from a CDN
- How the 12-column Grid system work
	- Rows & columns
	- Responsive to screen width
- How to quickly incoporate a Bootstrap element from the official Bootstrap docs

### Materials
- [Official Bootstrap 3.3.5 Documentation](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.5/docs/)
- [Existing Bootstrap templates you can already use!](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/)
- [Quick video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no-Ntkc836w)

### Mini Lesson
- [Bootstrap lesson slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17bEC3-xOEy8lt1BoT3hpQTABOUTKB7ueZeJQRiQ2YW0/edit#slide=id.g22b045fc2c_0_8)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- There is a bootstrap.css and a bootstrap.js.  Bootstrap.css is what most people refer to when they talk about Bootstrap.  Bootstrap.js is only necessary to accompany bootstrap.css to make interactive components like drop-down menu/modals/etc to work.
- Bootstrap.js needs jQuery to run.  
- There is no need to download either Bootstrap files; simply use a CDN link.  
- Bootstrap v4 is still in beta release, so it is generally better to use V3.3.7. 

### Independent Practice
- [Bootstrap lab exercise](curriculum/express/bootstrap-lab-exercise.md)

### Challenge
Using online resources, get a Bootstrap modal component to work! (open and close)

### Check for Understanding
Students should be able to draw a wireframe diagram demonstrating how the 12-colum grid system work.
