# Machine Learning Engineer

### Projected Time

30-55 minutes
- 35-40 min Lesson
- 10-20 min Independent Practice
- 5-10 min Check for Understanding

### Prerequisites

- The main prerequisite for machine learning is data analysis.

### Motivation

- Machine learning(ML) is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- Machine learning is given so much importance because it helps in predicting behavior and recognizing patterns that humans with their limited capacity cannot predict. It is important because every field wants automatic, adaptive, optimize and want to take the decision itself without any human interface.

**Which companies use Machine Learning?** Everyone.  Some companies are [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) and [Google Gmail](https://www.gmail.com).

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- understand what Machine Learning mean.
- why it is so important nowadays.
- applications of Machine Learning.

### Specific Things To Teach

- What is machine learning?
- types of the machine learning algorithm
    - supervised learning 
    - unsupervised learning
- application of machine learning

### Materials

- [Introduction to Machine Learning(15 min read)](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471)
- [Introduction to Machine Learning video (8 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU&t=10s)
- [Types of Learning video (9 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE5QZ8G_78c)

### Misconceptions
- Machine learning is just summarizing data. In reality, the main purpose of machine learning is to predict the future.
- Learning algorithms just discover correlations between pairs of events.
- Machine learning can only discover correlations, not causal relationships.
- Machine learning will soon give rise to superhuman intelligence.
