# Machine Learning Engineer

### Projected Time

30-55 minutes
- 35-40 min Lesson
- 10-20 min Independent Practice
- 5-10 min Check for Understanding

### Prerequisites

Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson:

- Example: [Git version control](version-control/git-version-control/git-version-control.md)
- The main prerequisite for machine learning is [data analysis](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/roles-in-tech/data-science.md).

### Motivation

- Machine learning(ML) is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- Machine learning is given so much importance because it helps in predicting behavior and recognizing patterns that humans with their limited capacity cannot predict. It is important because every field wants automatic, adaptive, optimize and want to take the decision itself without any human interface.

**Which companies use Machine Learning?** Everyone.  Some companies are [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) and [Google Gmail](https://www.gmail.com).

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- understand what Machine Learning mean.
- why it is so important nowadays.
- applications of Machine Learning.

### Specific Things To Teach

- What is machine learning?
- types of the machine learning algorithm
    - supervised learning 
    - unsupervised learning
- application of machine learning

### Materials

- [Example video (10 min)](https://example.com)

(Be sure to explain how to use these materials in directions in one of the sections below (ie: lesson, guided practice).  If you are not assigning them somehow, they should be placed under supplemental materials.)

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

- [Be sure to link the slideshow, video,](google.com)
- [or other materials you expect them to follow as part of the lesson.](google.com)

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- [Introduction to Machine Learning(15 min read)](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471)
- [Introduction to Machine Learning video (8 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU&t=10s)
- [Types of Learning video (9 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE5QZ8G_78c)


### Misconceptions
- Machine learning is just summarizing data. In reality, the main purpose of machine learning is to predict the future.
- Learning algorithms just discover correlations between pairs of events.
- Machine learning can only discover correlations, not causal relationships.
- Machine learning will soon give rise to superhuman intelligence.
