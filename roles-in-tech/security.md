- [How the Internet Works Topic Outline](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/requests-and-responses/requests-and-responses.md)
- [Intro to Security](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/security/web-security.md)

### Motivation
- Computer security is important, primarily to *keep your information protected*. It’s also important for your computer’s overall health, helping to prevent viruses and malware and allowing programs to run more smoothly.

- Security is the process of **preventing** and **detecting** unauthorized use of computer. *Prevention* helps in stopping unauthorized users to access part of the system. *Detection* helps to determine whether or not someone has tried to break into your system.

Apprentices will learn secure development basics, common pitfalls, and how to avoid them.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to learn:**
- Risk Management
- Cryptography & PKI
- Identity and access Management
- How to implement secure n/w architecture and system design
- Discover security vulnerabilities across an entire network

### Specific Things To Teach
The basic required skills as an Security Engineer are
- Programming Skills
- Communication Skills
- Risk Management
- Networking Basics
- Situational Awareness
- Toolkit Maintenance

One can join course [CompTIA Security+ Certification](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) or [CCNA Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-security.html#~stickynav=1) to improve the basics of security

After gaining basic skills one can go further as *Security Architect* or *Security Analyst* or *CISO* or any further specialization

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
These are some misconceptions that people have in their mind but it is not always true

- **Strong passwords are good enough** - It is not necessary to have a strong password but it is also important that how strongly you have designed. i.e. use of special characters or alphanumeric characters. Adding more than one layer of security better than only setting passwords.

- **Antivirus will secure my computer** - It is one of the most common misconception. But as virus is a piece of code, anti-virus is also the piece of code. They both are created by those having knowledge of both and to fight against each other and competitive to each other.

- **Cyber Security is just a form of defense** - “The best defense is a good offense.”

- **You will never be attacked** - Unfortunately, the attacked business is often the last to know that it's been breached. It's only after banks discover fraudulent charges that businesses hear about a suspected hack.

- **Hackers are criminals** - It is a big misconception. There are type of hackers and not all hackers are criminals. There are three types of hackers called - *White Hat Hackers(Who 'hacks' legally)* , *Grey Hat Hackers(who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but do not have the malicious intent)* and *Black Hat Hackers(Illegal hacking)*.

- **If wi-fi has a passwords, then it is secure** - If the person who travels to different workplaces and needs to use public wi-fi it is not recommended to do sensitive transactions through it. The same password is shared with many users and anyone can see the information that is being transferred.

- **By turning off GPS, you will not be traced** - Almost half of people surveyed either didn't know or were unsure whether disabling GPS prevents all tracking. Your phone's built-in location service is just one way data can be collected. As Pew Research notes, your phone also connects to cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, and connection to these technologies allows tracking too.

- **Emails are secure** - Over 400 businesses are targeted daily, and these emails are growing increasingly and it is challenging to identify since they’re designed to mimic legitimate communication so they can gain access to your sensitive information – including usernames and passwords.

- **Small organizations will not be attacked** - Major organizations assume that they are small and will not be targeted as we are small company. The research shows that 70% of cyber attacks target small businesses. So today for everyone it is very important to take care of its security if its data is worth value for money, whether it is a website for fun or it is a huge organization.

### Guided Practice
- *Talk to as many professionals as you can*

 [National Cyber Security Centre](https://live.ncsc.gov.uk/topics/new-talent) is worth for who lives in UK

### Independent Practice
- *You can play a game* called [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/about) that involves using reverse engineering, hacking, decryption and other skills to resolve the mystery behind the sudden disappearance of your character’s father.

- *Experiment with second computer*. Firstly, install Linux, BSD, Qubes OS and other operating systems on it.
Then, plug it to an Arduino board (i.e. an electronics platform that can read input like a light or touch sensor or your social media messages), and turn it into an output (publishing something on Twitter, switching on an LED or whatever).
Don’t forget. Install security and (with permission) monitor the networks that you connect to.

## Understanding the Field
- *Don’t underestimate the importance of ethics and integrity*

	Working in cyber security, you need to be behaving responsibility and with integrity at all times – an especially fraught task given the nature of the work. So, think about the content you publish on your social media accounts and be especially wary of posting insensitive material which could come back to haunt you later in life. You need to be able to demonstrate you’re trustworthy.

### What Kinds of Security Jobs Are There?

As a software developer of any kind, you'll need to know the basics of securing your code. But there are also specialized roles in security.

- [Cybersecurity job titles and short descriptions](https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu/cybersecurity-roles-and-job-titles)
- Many organizations, no matter their domain or product, have positions that are specific to security. If you wanted to specialize in security, there are security roles at all kinds of companies.
	- [Eventbrite](https://www.themuse.com/jobs/eventbrite/security-engineer), a python shop whose product handles event registration and promotion, is "looking for a Security Engineer to assist with security initiatives, project consultation and risk assessments. You will assess threats and vulnerabilities, analyze data and code, oversee testing and deployment, and ensure ongoing monitoring."
    - [Sample systems security job description [Workable]](https://resources.workable.com/system-security-engineer-job-description)
    - Organizations also often need non-engineering roles to govern the security or trust of their software. Trust & abuse teams solve problems relating to misuse that can deter other users from the product. Large companies often have risk & governance positions to identify a company's largest risks; A "cybersecurity risk & governance" professional will assess a company's software risks to prioritize security work accordingly.
    - Forensics and investigations.

- Other companies focus on security. These will have security roles, R&D roles, as well as more general software developer roles. If you wanted to work on security, such an organization might make sense. Or if you're interested in security, but still want to work as more of a generalist, you could work on a product that's security-minded.
    - [Endgame](https://www.endgame.com/careers/) needs security engineers and researchers, since it's a provider of enterprise security software, but it also has a web team for its product.
    - Still other organizations deliver "white hat hacker" services such as [pen testing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing/). "White hat" hackers are hired to attack systems to discover vulnerabilities before "black hat" hackers find them, and deliver such findings to their client in a report. These systems can be software the company has developed or is bringing in from outside; they can also be internal or external tests of a company's network. This is even more specialized, but interesting!
    - Security consulting firms will often offer many roles as contract services or managed services embedded within a client organization, including pen-testing, code auditing, network analysis, system design, and reverse engineering.
    - Research-oriented work can range from threat research and bug-hunting to application, [protocol](https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/moore_cisco.pdf), malware analysis. [Example analysis of MQ software used by backend systems](https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/assets/BlogFiles/mwri-websphere-mq-security-white-paper-part1-2008-05-06.pdf).
- Bug bounty programs usually include security vulnerabilities.
	- One aggregator of bug bounty programs: [bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/)
