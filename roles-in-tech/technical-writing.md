### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

*Here are some of the common mistakes Technical Writers do-*  
- **Messy Structure** : Many technical documents confuse readers and fail to achieve their aims because they were not planned properly to begin with.
- **Poor punctuation** : All writers have a passing knowledge of the main set of punctuation marks. Very few, however, outside of professional authors and editors, have a thorough grasp of how each one works. 
- **Too much abstraction** : People writing in a formal or semi-formal context often go overboard in an effort to make their prose sound proper and elevated.
