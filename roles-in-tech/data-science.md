(Be sure to explain how to use these materials in directions in one of the sections below (ie: lesson, guided practice).  If you are not assigning them somehow, they should be placed under supplemental materials.) 

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

- [or other materials you expect them to follow as part of the lesson.](google.com)

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

- Example
- Example


### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they've learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding. This exercise should help apprentices determine whether they've met the outline objectives.
