# Data Science

### Projected Time

- About 1 hour

### Prerequisites

No Prerequisites.

### Motivation

*Data science is a sexy job. The salaries are high, the work is interesting, and thereâ€™s significant prestige that comes with the title.*

* **[Bill James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_James)** applied data analysis to baseball
    * Who are the top performers? 
    * How can you best predict future performance?

* **Netflix** uses data analysis to recommend movies.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Analyze data
- Learn from data
- Use pandas and numpy
- Predict Outcomes

### Specific Things To Teach

- Analyzing Data 
- Cleaning Data using Pandas & Numpy
	- Gaining insights
- Building models on data

### Materials

- [Pandas (10 min read)](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html)
- [Numpy (20 min video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mpc9ukltVA)

### Lesson

**[Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)** is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.

- Tools like Pandas, Numpy, Hadoop, Spark etc 
  comprise an important part of the data science toolbox. 
  It is up to the data scientist to figure out which tool to use in different 
  circumstances (as well as how to use the tool correctly) in order to solve analytically 
  open-ended problems.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Access to More Data Translates to Higher Accuracy
- Data Science and Business Intelligence Are the Same
- You Must Have Access to Lots of Data

### Guided Practice
