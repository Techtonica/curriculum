## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants should be able to:

1. Understand the evolving role of software engineers in the age of AI-generated code
2. Identify high-value skills that complement rather than compete with AI capabilities
3. Develop strategies for career growth that leverage AI as a tool rather than viewing it as a threat
4. Articulate their unique value proposition as human engineers in an AI-augmented industry
5. Create a personal development roadmap that focuses on AI-resistant skills


## Motivation

As AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and other code generation platforms become increasingly sophisticated, many aspiring and early-career software engineers worry about their future prospects. However, the rise of AI presents not just challenges but tremendous opportunities for those who understand how to position themselves effectively. This lesson explores how to thrive as a software engineer by developing skills that complement AI rather than compete with it directly.

The most successful engineers of the future won't be those who can write code the fastest, but those who can:

- Effectively define problems worth solving
- Architect systems that are maintainable, scalable, and secure
- Collaborate with both humans and AI tools
- Translate business requirements into technical solutions
- Evaluate and improve AI-generated code

## Lesson Activities

### Activity 1: AI Tool Exploration (60 minutes)

**Objective:** Gain hands-on experience with AI coding tools and develop critical evaluation skills.


**Self-Guided Practice (40 minutes):**

*Part 1: Basic Exploration (15 minutes)*

1. Select one of the following tasks:
      - Create a function to validate email addresses with specific requirements
      - Build a simple API endpoint that handles pagination
      - Implement a caching mechanism for expensive operations
2. Use your chosen AI tool to generate a solution, experimenting with at least 3 different prompting approaches
3. Document each prompt used and the resulting code
4. Note which prompt produced the best result and why you think it worked better


*Part 2: Critical Evaluation (15 minutes)*

1. Using the evaluation rubric, assess the best generated code for:
      - Correctness (Does it work as expected?)
      - Security (Are there any vulnerabilities?)
      - Performance (Are there inefficiencies?)
      - Readability (Is it well-documented and clear?)
      - Edge cases (What scenarios might break it?)
2. Identify at least 3 specific improvements needed
3. Score each aspect from 1-5 and note specific issues found


*Part 3: Code Improvement (10 minutes)*

1. Improve the code by:
      - Either manually editing the code to fix the identified issues
      - Or crafting a new prompt that addresses the identified issues
2. Document the improvements made and the reasoning behind them
3. Compare the original and improved versions


**Reflection (10 minutes):**

1. In your notebook, reflect on:
      - What surprised you about the AI's capabilities or limitations?
      - Which prompting techniques were most effective and why?
      - What types of issues did you consistently need to fix?
      - How might you integrate this tool into your workflow?
2. Create a personal list of "AI Tool Best Practices" based on your findings


**Evaluation Rubric Template:**

```plaintext
AI-Generated Code Evaluation

Task: [Description of the task]
AI Tool Used: [Tool name]
Prompt Used: [Your best prompt]

Criteria | Score (1-5) | Issues Found | Improvements Made
---------|-------------|--------------|------------------
Correctness | | | 
Security | | | 
Performance | | | 
Readability | | | 
Edge Case Handling | | | 

Overall Assessment:
Strengths:
Weaknesses:
```

**Starter AI-Generated Code for Email Validation Task:**

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  // Simple regex to check if email is valid
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}

// Example usage
console.log(validateEmail("user@example.com")); // true
console.log(validateEmail("invalid-email")); // false
```

*⚠️ Note: This starter code has intentional limitations - it doesn't check for many edge cases, doesn't validate domain specifics, and uses a simplistic regex that could allow invalid emails.*

### Activity 2: Problem-Solving Beyond AI (90 minutes)

**Objective:** Develop skills in requirements gathering, problem definition, and solution design that go beyond what AI can currently do well.

**Self-Guided Practice (70 minutes):**

*Part 1: Requirements Analysis (25 minutes)*

2. Imagine you're working with a stakeholder who has provided this vague request
3. Write down at least 10 clarifying questions you would ask to better understand:
      - Core business objectives
      - User needs and pain points
      - Technical constraints
      - Success metrics
4. For each question, provide a hypothetical answer that would help clarify the requirements
5. Based on these hypothetical answers, document the requirements using the template


*Part 2: Problem Definition (20 minutes)*

1. Based on your requirements analysis, define:
      - The core problem to solve (in one sentence)
      - Key constraints and considerations
      - Assumptions that need validation
      - Potential risks and edge cases
2. Create a prioritized list of features/requirements
3. Identify which aspects of the problem are most ambiguous and why


*Part 3: Solution Design (25 minutes)*

1. Sketch a high-level solution approach addressing:
      - Component breakdown (what are the main parts of your solution?)
      - Data flow (how does information move through your system?)
      - User interactions (how do users engage with your solution?)
      - Technical considerations (what technologies would you use?)
2. Identify areas where AI tools could help implement the solution
3. Highlight aspects that would require human judgment or expertise
4. Note any trade-offs in your design and why you made those choices


**Reflection (10 minutes):**

1. In your notebook, reflect on:
      - What aspects of this problem would be difficult for AI to solve alone?
      - How did you handle ambiguity in the requirements?
      - What additional information would have been most valuable?
      - How might you approach similar ambiguous problems in the future?

2. Create a personal checklist for approaching ambiguous problems

**Problem Scenario:**

```plaintext
Healthcare Notification System

A healthcare provider has approached you to design a notification system for their patient portal. They want patients to receive timely updates about appointments, medication schedules, and test results.

The system should be user-friendly and ensure all communications are secure and compliant with relevant regulations. They want to implement this within the next quarter and have a moderate budget.

Your task is to define the requirements and design a solution for this notification system.

## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

1. **Misconception: AI will completely replace software engineers.**
  - Reality: AI is transforming the role of engineers, not eliminating it. The focus is shifting from writing every line of code to higher-level problem-solving, system design, and ensuring quality and security.

2. **Misconception: I need to compete with AI on coding speed and knowledge.**
  - Reality: Your value as an engineer increasingly comes from skills AI lacks: creativity, contextual understanding, ethical judgment, and interpersonal collaboration.

3. **Misconception: Learning to code is becoming less valuable.**
  - Reality: Understanding code remains essential, but the emphasis is shifting toward knowing how to evaluate, modify, and integrate code rather than writing everything from scratch.

4. **Misconception: Junior engineers will have no place in the industry.**
  - Reality: Entry-level roles are evolving, not disappearing. Junior engineers who can effectively collaborate with AI tools while developing system-level thinking will be highly valuable.

5. **Misconception: AI tools always produce optimal code.**
  - Reality: AI-generated code often requires significant human review and modification to address security concerns, performance issues, and specific business requirements.

6. **Misconception: Technical skills are all that matter.**
  - Reality: As AI handles more routine coding tasks, human-centric skills like communication, collaboration, and business domain knowledge become increasingly important differentiators.

7. **Misconception: Once I learn to use AI tools, I'm set for my career.**
  - Reality: Both AI capabilities and industry needs will continue evolving rapidly. Continuous learning and adaptability remain essential for long-term career success.
