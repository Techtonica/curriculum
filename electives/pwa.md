# Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

### Prerequisites

- [HTML/CSS Lessons](/html-css)
- [JavaScript Lessons](/javascript)
- [React Lessons](/react-js)

### Motivation

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) represent the next evolution in web development, combining the best features of web and native applications. They provide a seamless user experience with features like offline functionality, push notifications, and app-like interactions, all while maintaining the accessibility and reach of web applications. PWAs are becoming increasingly important as they bridge the gap between web and native apps, offering a cost-effective solution for businesses to reach users across all platforms.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**:

- Understand what Progressive Web Apps are and their key features
- Learn about service workers and their role in PWAs
- Implement offline functionality in web applications
- Create and deploy a basic PWA
- Understand PWA best practices and performance optimization

### Specific Things to Learn

- Core concepts of Progressive Web Apps
- Service Worker lifecycle and implementation
- Web App Manifest creation and configuration
- Caching strategies for offline functionality
- Push notifications implementation
- PWA performance optimization techniques
- Tools for auditing and improving PWA performance

### Materials

- [MDN Web Docs: Progressive Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
- [Google's PWA Documentation](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)
