### Projected Time


### Prerequisites


### Motivation
I want to style tags differently that have the same name.


### Objective
**Students will be able to**:
- add an id and classes to a tag
- write css that selects combinations of tags, classes, and an id
- explain when to use a class vs an id

### Specific Things To Teach
- "class" and "id" are attributes
- each "id" can only appear once on the page
- classes can be reused, and one tag can even have multiple
  - multiple classes are separated by whitespace
- css selector for class is ".class-name"
- css selector for id is "#id-name"
- css selectors can be chained together: "p#id-name.class-name.another-class-name"
