# 🌲 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) – Interactive Guide

---

## 📌 What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?

A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight and **no cycles**.

### 🌟 Real-World Applications
- Network design (telephone, electrical, computer)
- Road or pipeline construction
- Cluster analysis in Machine Learning

## 🔍 MST Algorithms Overview

We’ll focus on two main MST algorithms:

### 1. 🟢 Prim’s Algorithm

- Greedy algorithm
- Start from any vertex and grow the MST one edge at a time.
- Always pick the smallest weight edge that connects a visited node to an unvisited node.

**Steps:**
1. Choose a starting vertex.
2. Add the smallest edge that connects MST to a new node.
3. Repeat until all vertices are in the MST.

(We will use JavaScript or p5.js for this in future steps.)

### 2. 🟡 Kruskal’s Algorithm

- Greedy algorithm
- Sort all edges in increasing order of weight.
- Add the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle using Union-Find (Disjoint Set).

**Steps:**
1. Sort all edges.
2. Initialize each node as a separate tree.
3. Add edges one by one — avoid cycles.
4. Stop when MST has (V-1) edges.

## ⚙️ Interactive Walkthrough Idea

We aim to build an **interactive visualization** where:
- Users can click to add nodes and edges
- Choose Prim’s or Kruskal’s
- See steps unfold live (highlighting edges, nodes, weights)
- Display total weight and edges used

> 🛠 Example Frameworks: JavaScript + HTML Canvas or p5.js

## 🧠 Summary

| Algorithm | Strategy | Data Structures | Time Complexity |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Prim’s   | Grow MST from one vertex | Min-Heap / Priority Queue | O(E log V) |
| Kruskal’s| Add lightest edges | Disjoint Set (Union-Find) | O(E log E) |
