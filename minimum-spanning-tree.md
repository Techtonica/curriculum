# 🌲 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) – Interactive Guide



## 🎯 Motivation

Have you ever needed to connect multiple cities with the least amount of road? Or set up a network using the least cable? These are real-world examples of a **Minimum Spanning Tree**. Understanding MST helps solve problems efficiently for this such as:
- Network design (telephone, electrical, computer)
- Road or pipeline construction
- Cluster analysis in Machine Learning

# Time and Space Complexity
This section explains how the execution time and memory usage scale with the size of the input graph.

| Complexity     | Description                                                                | Context                                    |   Growth Rate                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------
| **O(E log V)** | Time complexity involving both edges (E) and the logarithm of vertices (V) | Graph algorithms                            | Grows logarithmically with vertices but                        scales linearly with edges |
| **O(log N)**   | Pure logarithmic complexity in terms of size N                             | General algorithms                          | Pure logarithmic growth without additional scaling factors         |
| **O(E log E)** | Time complexity where both linear and logarithmic factors depend on edges  | Graph algorithms with edge-based operations | Similar to O(E log V) but grows faster when E > V                  |


Key Relationships
O(E log V) vs O(E log E):
Both scale linearly with E.
O(E log E) grows faster than O(E log V) when E > V.
They are equivalent when E ≈ V (e.g., in complete graphs).

Relationship to O(log N):
O(log N) grows much slower than the others.
As E increases, the gap between O(log N) and the others widens significantly.

Practical Implications
O(E log E) appears in algorithms that primarily operate on edges (e.g., Kruskal’s Algorithm).
O(E log V) is common when operations involve both vertices and edges (e.g., Prim’s Algorithm with a min-heap).
The choice between them depends on whether vertex count (V) or edge count (E) is smaller for your specific graph.




## 🚀 What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?
A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight and **no cycles**.



## 🌐 Real-World Uses of MST

- Designing road or pipeline networks.
- Creating efficient communication networks.
- Cluster analysis in Machine Learning.



## ⚙️ Prim’s Algorithm

**Strategy**: Start with one vertex and grow the tree by adding the smallest edge connected to it.

### 🔄 Steps:
1. Start with any node.
2. Add the smallest edge that connects to a new node.
3. Repeat until all nodes are included.

**Data Structure Used**: Min-Heap (Priority Queue)

## 📊 Visual Example  
![Prim’s Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prim-animation.gif)

### 🧪 Starter Code (Python)

```python
import heapq

def prim(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    min_heap = [(0, start)]
    total_weight = 0
    
    while min_heap:
        weight, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        total_weight += weight
        for neighbor, edge_weight in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (edge_weight, neighbor))
    
    return total_weight 
 ```

## ⚒️ Kruskal’s Algorithm
Strategy: Add the smallest edge without forming a cycle until all nodes are connected.

🔄 Steps:
1. Sort all edges by weight.
2. Initialize each node as its own tree.
3. Add edges one by one — skip if they create a cycle.
4. Stop when MST has (V-1) edges.

**Data Structure Used:** Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

🧪 Starter Code (Python)
```python

def find(parent, i):
    if parent[i] != i:
        parent[i] = find(parent, parent[i])
    return parent[i]

def union(parent, rank, x, y):
    root_x = find(parent, x)
    root_y = find(parent, y)
    if rank[root_x] < rank[root_y]:
        parent[root_x] = root_y
    elif rank[root_x] > rank[root_y]:
        parent[root_y] = root_x
    else:
        parent[root_y] = root_x
        rank[root_x] += 1

def kruskal(V, edges):
    parent = [i for i in range(V)]
    rank = [0] * V
    result = []
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by weight

    for u, v, weight in edges:
        if find(parent, u) != find(parent, v):
            union(parent, rank, u, v)
            result.append((u, v, weight))
    
    return result 
```

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **O(E log V)** | Depends on number of edges and log of vertices   | Prim’s Algorithm with heap              |
| **O(E log E)** | Depends mainly on number of edges (from sorting) | Kruskal’s Algorithm                     |
| **O(log N)**   | Logarithmic growth                               | Union-Find operations / Tree operations |


### 💡 Note:

-When the graph is dense (many edges), Prim’s is usually faster.
-When the graph is sparse, both perform similarly.
