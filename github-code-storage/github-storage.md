# GitHub for Code Storage

### Projected Time
About 1.5 hour
- 45 minutes for the Lesson
- 30 minutes for Independent Practice
- 15 minutes for Group Practice

### Prerequisites
- "Command Line Interface" lesson
- "Git & Version Control" lesson

### Motivation
GitHub is a widely-used code storage and code collaboration tool. In this lesson we cover the storage aspects of GitHub. In another lesson, we'll cover the collaboration aspects of GitHub.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to**
- Explain the difference between Git and GitHub
- Create their own GitHub account
- Push code from their local machine to GitHub
- Identify what should be included in a README

### Specific Things To Teach
- Create a new GitHub repository
- Link a GitHub repo to a Git repo on your local machine
- Push a project from your local machine to its respective GitHub repo
- What makes an effective README

### Supplemental Materials

- [GitHub "Hello, World!"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

### Lesson

1. [GitHub for Code Storage (video walkthrough of slides)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rAf_DvSqiX93eELqVIKUlD7Y5H-QZtSu)
* Please watch the video the first time without working along with the demonstration. Jus absorb the concepts. Then, you can watch the demonstration a second time and code with the instructor if you like.

2. [GitHub for Code Storage (slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wlhPFx4oq3xWWdPqwf8CP6cmcuo7gaQ0UeOcKocSjp8/edit?usp=sharing)

3. [Art of README (30 minute read)](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"The Git repo on my laptop is the same thing as the GitHub repo."** The Git repo you may have for a particular project on your laptop _gets attached to_ the GitHub repo you set up to store all it's code in. The changes you make in your Git repo on your laptop won't transfer over to your GitHub repo until you run the `git push -u origin master` command.

- **"I can only push perfect and polished code to GitHub."** Lots of people use GitHub to showcase finished projects, but lots of people also use GitHub to store their projects-in-progress. Your code does not need to be perfect, especially as a junior software engineer. If you are really worried about people seeing your code before you deem it "ready", consider upgrading from a free account to the lowest-tier paid plan (currently $7/mo), which allows you to have an unlimited number of private repos. All Techtonica assignments must be pushed to public repos, however.

### Demonstration

In the video walkthrough, the instructor demonstrates the proper GitHub workflow for creating and pushing to repos.


### Independent Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pairs. With your pair, go through the demonstration in the video walkthrough with a new project (not the one you started in the "Git & Version Control" lesson).

### Group Practice

The group will tell the instructor, or a fellow classmate, how to get through the GitHub workflow presented in this lesson. This should be done from memory, and the instructor or classmate will work on a computer attached to the projector.

### Challenge
Work through [this Git and GitHub tutorial for Beginners](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners), which reinforces all of the concepts we covered in this lesson, plus some more advanced topics such as branching, merging and pull requests. Fun!

### Check for Understanding

2 days after presenting this lesson, have participants go through the workflow again individually by creating a new project locally and pushing it to GitHub. They can use any resource except the slides and video walkthrough. They should email the instructor a copy of their Terminal session.
