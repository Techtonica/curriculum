# Computer Science Fundamentals

### Projected Time
12 Hours

### Prerequisites
none

### Motivation
Web development is one facet of programming but there are CS fundamentals that should be reviewed
so that you understand the mechanics happening behind the scenes. Here are a few great resources for starting out.
If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area and you get a SFPL library card, you get free access to Lynda and Treehouse!


### Objectives
**Participants will be able to**

### Specific Things to Learn
- Things about the things
- More things about the things
	- This is a sub-thing about the things
- Even more things about the things
- Even more things about the things

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Build on the first information. Have participants guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:
- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that participants might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: thing


### Guided Practice

Have the participants work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Participants can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have participants summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
