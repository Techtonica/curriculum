### Motivation
Structuring data, and deciding how to organize and store data in non-arbitrary ways is one way to create performant programs. When data is efficiently structured and organized, data manipulation can be optimized. Some types of data structures include primitive variables (the simplest type of data structures), pointers, arrays (great for storing a list of a fixed length), linked lists (great for storing a number of data items that can easily change size to add or remove items), doubly linked lists, queues (first in first out data storage/traversal), stacks (last in, first out data traversal), trees (data structure consisting of one or more data nodes—an XML document with a root node is a good example), binary trees (great for storing records that can be accessed in a key, value pair), priority queues (array that searches for the lowest cost contained and appends it to the end), hash tables (used to implement key, value, dictionary-like interfaces). Some other data structures include record, union, tagged union, class, graphs, and binary trees.

### Objectives
**Apprentices will be able to**
- Consider data structure availability when problem solving
- Contrast data structures with data types
- Identify main types of data structures, along with their pros and cons
- Classic use cases for each data structure

### Materials

- [Overview of common data structures](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/data-structures/)
- [Data Structures: Crash Course Computer Science #14 ](https://youtu.be/DuDz6B4cqVc)
- [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/data_structures_basics.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/data_structures_basics.htm)
- [Data Structure: Queue - Abstract Data Type](https://youtu.be/PjQdvpWfCmE)

### Mini Lesson


### Independent Practice 

1. Using the links available in the Common Mistakes section, create a diagram outlining the key functional differences between type and structure.
2. Watch Crash Course Computer Science #14 video.
3. Read Top Coder & Tutorials Point.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

[Data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) and [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) are not the same. 

### Check for Understanding

Using a timer, apprentices will pair up for 15 minutes and quiz each other while reviewing the differences between data types and data structures. After the ten minute timer goes off, you will switch roles and the person being quizzed first will begin quizzing.
