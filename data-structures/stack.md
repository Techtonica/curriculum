# Stacks

### Projected Time

About 1 hour

### Prerequisites

JS 
Functional programming

### Motivation

Stack is one of the most commonly used data structure along with its opposite relative, queue. Understanding how to implement stack helps you better understand and describe insertion, removal, and organization of data in a sequential order.

### Objectives

Explain what a stack data structure is and show how it is implemented.

### Specific Things To Teach

- Definition of stack
- Show an example of stack data structure
- JavaScript methods used to implement stack

### Supplemental Materials

- [GeeksforGeeks: Implementation of Stack in JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-stack-javascript/)
- [InitJS: Implement a Stack in JavaScript](https://initjs.org/data-structure-stack-in-javascript-714f45dbf889)
- [Cloudboost: Data Structures in JavaScript: Stacks & Queues](https://blog.cloudboost.io/data-structures-in-javascript-stacks-queues-75d83cd9f7e1)

### Lesson

- Lesson slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lOqqqXF-NYzFw0Cu3vIa-dLZeERGhcg1SFmOgW4Y62w/edit#slide=id.p
- Lesson video: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ioFhuH4I0J5gAnwyw6SJxWzioAWKNrZp

Make sure to mention these things:
- Explain what LIFO and FILO means.
- Differentiate stack and queue.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Array and stack seem similar at first glance. While stack can be implemented using array, the data in array can be accessed randomly, whereas stack must be accessed according to order.

### Guided Practice

Explain and discuss as a class the steps involved in writing a stack structure, including:
- Constructor
- Push/Enqueue
- Pop/Dequeue
- Size control

### Independent Practice

Try to write a Stack class with the steps discussed as methods:
```
var Stack = function() {}
  // Constructor

  // Push

  // Pop

  // Size management of stack

  // Output of stack
}
```

### Challenge / Check for Understanding

Find a partner and show each other your own Stack class. Explain how the class you wrote works.
