### Motivation

User Interfaces (UI) and User Experiences (UX) describe the things users see and feel when they interact with a product, be it a website, a mobile app, or even a physical gadget. Almost all tech companies build products of some kind or another, and it's imperative that their products be well-received and well-loved by their users.

**Companies that focus on UI/UX designs:**
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/): Amazon is a prime example of a company that has built its success and ROI upon a focus on customer experience throughout the entire customer journey and that continually measures the user experience.[(interaction-design.org)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/improve-customer-experience-with-ux-investments-that-increase-roi)
-[Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/)

### Things to Remember

- Interface design is often seen as the "visible things on screen". In fact, it is about the experience, but not just the experience using the app, it's about the whole user experience, including the one outside the app. Designers must immerse themselves into the user's mind and life.

- The iterative aspect of the design process is key. Designer motto: **The first design is never right**. A good designer always refines solutions and explores options.

### Independent Practice

Pairs will not be assigned for this exercise.

**Activity #1 - Design Improvements**
Pick an app or website whose UI or UX you dislike and spend 10 minutes making a list of things that could be improved.

Focus of the following:
- Am I able to complete the tasks for which the interface is built for?
- Why would I **not** use the app on a daily basis?
- Details matter. How is the copywriting? The app's personality? The visual language? The colors? The information density?
- List other annoyances you might see, hear, or feel

**Activity #2 - Design Successes**
Name something (an app, an object, an experience, a place) that you use regularly and that is truly making your life better. It doesn't have to be an application or software.

Spend 10 minutes writing down your feelings: Why do you use this in particular? Why not another app?

What do you think stands out in terms of the following?:
- Emotional response
- Usefulness
- Usability
- Simplicity
- Sense of community
- Speed

### Group Practice

Find a pair and share your findings for Activity #1 and Activity #2. Swap pairs and share once more.

### Check for Understanding

- How are they different?
- How do UX and UI work together?
- Cite an example of good UI?
