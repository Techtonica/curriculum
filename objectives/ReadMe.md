# Assessment Objectives: A Grader's Guide

### How to Use

The files in the objectives folder each contain a checklist of the objectives covered in worksheets, projects, and assessments.

As an example, "0.md" contains the things learners should demonstrate in "Week 1 Worksheet". If a participant fails to demonstrate understanding, they should receive feedback from the grader that they need to put additional effort into meeting that objective. In most cases, this will mean improving their submitted project, but otherwise the participant may be required to submit an additional code challenge or write-up to prove they've truly learned the concept.
