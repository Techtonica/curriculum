### 1. It always takes the same amount of time to find the first element in an array. What is the time complexity (Big O)?
- [ ] Constant time - Constant Complexity O(1)
- [ ] Linear time - Linear Complexity O(n)
- [ ] Quadratic time - Quadratic Complexity O(n^2)
- [ ] I think I kind of understand
- [ ] I don't understand at all

### 2. An algorithm has linear complexity if the time it takes to execute is directly dependent on the size of the input
- [ ] True
- [ ] False
- [ ] I think I kind of understand
- [ ] I don't understand at all

### 3. Run time complexity is:
- [ ] The number of inputs will have a problem for the space in your computer
- [ ] Time Complexity of an algorithm refers to its runtime in relation to an increase or decrease in the number of inputs.
- [ ] It refers to the relationship between your hardware and software
- [ ] I think I kind of understand
- [ ] I don't understand at all

- [ ] Accessing each element at a specific index in an array is an O(1) operation because it takes a constant amount of time to retrieve the element, regardless of the size of the array
- [ ] Inserting or deleting an element at a specific index in an array requires shifting all subsequent elements, which has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements after the insertion or deletion point
- [ ] The filter method iterates over each element in the array exactly once, performing a constant amount of work for each element. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the size of the input array (n)
- [ ] The code snippet uses divide-and-conquer algorithms such as merge sort, where the data set is repeatedly divided into smaller parts, sorted individually, and then combined

### 5. How do you create HTML forms?
- [ ] `<form> </form>`
- [ ] `<input> </input>`
- [ ] `<table> </table>`
- [ ] I think I kind of understand
- [ ] I don't understand at all

### 6. How do you add validation in the attributes?
- [ ] Using CSS rules
- [ ] You can only do that using DOM Manipulation.
- [ ] Using built-in HTML form validation or using Javascript
- [ ] I think I kind of understand
- [ ] I don't understand at all

### 7. How do you submit the form using HTML?
- [ ] Using DOM Manipulation for your form-handler function
- [ ] The `<input type="submit">` defines a submit button which submits all form values to a form-handler
- [ ] With the `<label type= "required">` option
- [ ] I think I kind of understand
- [ ] I don't understand at all
