# Assessment 11 Objectives

[Assessment Outline: Data Structures](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/main/projects/data-structures-algorithms-assessment.md)

These are all in **weighted order**, so most important topics are first.

## Stacks / Queues / Linked-Lists

- Linked-Lists
  - Big O performance of operations
  - Key difference between a linked-list and an array
  - Implement a linked-list from scratch in JS
  - Learn and tech linked-lists first because they are used by the other data structures
- Understand when to use a queue vs stack
- Be familiar with common interface methods (push, pop, peek)
- How is a stack used by your computer when running your own code (call stack)
  - Why can you get stack overflow?
- Implement a queue
  - using an Array as the underlying storage
  - using a Linked-List as the underlying storage
  - pros/cons for choosing Array vs Linked-List
- What is a priority queue? (Priority Queues are very popular interview questions)
- _Note: deque aka double-ended queue is not important to learn_

## Hash Table

- Why are Hash Tables useful?
  - The basic interface methods (get, set)
  - Know the Big O of hash table operations
- Be able to solve problems that uses JavaScript `Map` and `Set` to solve problems
  - Why use a Map vs Set?
- Basic idea behind a hashing function
  - What characteristics make an effective hashing function?
  - You don't necessarily need to be able to implement one yourself as doing it well is difficult

## Trees

- Binary trees are the most important type of tree
  - Searching a binary tree is one of the most core recursive algorithms used
  - If you understand binary search, most other operations will make sense
  - How to implement core methods (add, find) given Node and Tree class skeleton code
- Tries
  - A very useful type of tree, typically with 26 branches (a-z) at each node instead of 2
  - How tries store their information (different than most other trees)
- Examples of tree structures in the wild: DOM, Filesystem

## Array Sorting/Searching

- Binary search of a sorted array is one of the most fundamental algorithms
  - you should understand its pseudocode and be able to implement from scratch in JS
- Other Searching algorithms
  - Linear search: its Big O and how to implement it
- Simple sorting algorithms
  - Bubble
  - Selection
  - Know how to implement them
  - Know their Big O
- Fast Sorting Algorithms and their peformance
  - Merge
  - Know its Big O
  - Understand its pseudocode
  - You don't need to know how to implement from scratch
