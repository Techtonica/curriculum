# Techtonica Application Workshop Day 2

### Projected Time

2.5 hours

### Prerequisites

- You should be digitally literate before doing this workshopâ€”we define that as being able to use the mouse, keyboard, browser, and email easily.
- You should have already completed the day 1 workshop.

### Motivation

Doing this workshop is part of the Techtonica application process. It will give you a good idea of what it's like to learn technical concepts at Techtonica.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Write some beginner JavaScript
- Collaborate with others
- Figure out some new JavaScript concepts
- Connect their JavaScript to their HTML

### Specific Things To Learn

- Using HTML syntax and basic HTML tags: `<!DOCTYPE html>, <head>, <body>, <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <a>`
- Using CSS selectors, attributes, properties, values, and syntax

### Materials

- [HTML (cheatsheet)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-html-elements/reference)
- [CSS Glossary](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-css)
- [JavaScript I (slides)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WIm5UCQL9TOsmW5X6suapBhyEqtk8Y2oLKb5gUqbzus)


### Common Mistakes & Misconceptions

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can go in CodePen's HTML box, but they are different languages, so they'll need to be identified as those languages using HTML tags (`<style>` or `<script>`) (but let's keep them in their boxes for now).


### Practice


JavaScript
- Look over the JavaScript I slides linked above. 
- Make a JavaScript list of products to sell.
- Figure out how to display a random item from your list on the page (alongside/as part of HTML).
- Display the last item from your list on the page.
- Display all the list items longer than three letters.
- Check your indentation so your code is easy to read!
- Submit your CodePen link via email at the end of the workshop.


### Challenge

- Do this one on your own! Start a new CodePen. Can you write a JavaScript function that does the following?
	```
	Given a string, return a new string where the second and last characters are exchanged. 
	```
-Submit your CodePen link via email at the end of the workshop.

### Check for Understanding 

- Summarize to each other.
- Make a cheat sheet.
- Try making a new CodePen and doing it all again without looking at any resources.
