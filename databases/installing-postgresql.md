- leave this lesson knowing this
- and how to do this on their own
- Even more things
- Even more things

### Specific Things To Teach

- Focus on this specific talking point
- and this
	- This is a sub-thing about the thing

### Materials

- [Example video (10 min)](https://example.com) - Write a very short description of this resource.
- [Other example article(20 min read)](https://otherexample.com) - Answer the 3 questions at the end.
(Be sure to explain how to use these materials in directions in one of the sections below (ie: lesson, guided practice).  If you are not assigning them somehow, they should be placed under Supplemental Materials at the bottom.) 

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

- [Be sure to link the slideshow, video,](google.com)
- [or other materials you expect them to follow as part of the lesson.](google.com)

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step.  This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it's less guided, more independent.

### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they've learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps them self-assess their understanding. This exercise should help apprentices determine whether they've met the outline objectives, or if they need to review.
