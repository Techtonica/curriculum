# PostgreSQL Installation

## Projected Time

15 minutes

## Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Use PostgreSQL from the command line (`psql`) and, optionally, a GUI admin app

### Install PostgreSQL on Mac

- Follow the [Postgres Homebrew Instructions](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew)
- This creates a superuser named postgres
- If you run `psql` with no args, it assumes you want to connect as your current user (`whoami` command output)
- Run `psql postgres` to connect as the superuser
- `create database <YOUR_USERNAME>`
- `\q` to quit
- Now you can connect with just `psql`

### Configuration

Being a database, Postgres stores most of its settings in itself! So the config file isn't really useful for us.

## Postico GUI App

Install: https://eggerapps.at/postico/

If you created a DB of your user, it should work out of the box if you specify `localhost` to connect.

## PGAdmin GUI App

This is **not recommended** because it is too advanced and difficult to connect.

## Problems

**Passwords?** with the default setup you shouldn't need a password.

## Supplemental Materials
