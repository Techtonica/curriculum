# MongoDB

### Projected Time
4 - 5 hours
- 20-30 minutes for Lesson
- 20 minutes for Guided Practice
- 120 - 180 min for Independent Practice
- 15 minutes for Challenge
- 15 minutes for Check for Understanding

### Prerequisites
- Object Literals
- JSON
- Relational Databases
- .env

### Motivation
Not all data can be or should be stored in a relational way. In those cases, it is more efficient to use a NoSQL database. MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like "documents," which is familiar to folks who use JavaScript.


### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Set up MongoDB on their laptops
- Create databases and collections in MongoDB
- Add, query, and update documents

### Materials

- [TutorialsPoint MongoDB Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/)
- [MongoDB Full Tutorial w/ Node.js, Express, and Mongoose](https://youtu.be/4yqu8YF29cU)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I already learned how to use relational databases. I'll just stick with that. They both store data anyway."** The structure of relational databases is set up for relational data. Using a relational databse for non-relational data results in reduced scalability and added cost.

### Guided Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pairs.

**Activity 1: Installation**
1. Check to see if you have Homebrew installed on your laptop. From your Terminal, run the `brew help` command. If you have Homebrew installed, you'll see output from Homebrew appear in your Terminal. 

If no Homebrew-related text appears, you'll need to install Homebrew. Go to the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) and follow the installation instructions. Ask for help if needed.

2. To ensure you have the latest version of MongoDB, run `brew update` in the Terminal. This may take a couple minutes.

3. Install MongoDB using `brew install mongodb` in the Terminal. If you get an error message saying you need to install Xcode from the App Store, follow the instructions to do so and then re-try `brew install mongodb`. Ask for help if needed.

4. Make sure you have the directory /data/db. If not, run `sudo mkdir -p /data/db`. If this doesn't work, then try `brew services start mongodb`
5. Run `whoami` to find your username. For example, if your username is "myname", then you will run the following command `sudo chown myname /data/db`. You may need to enter your password.
6. If a ~/.bash_profile exists, open it. If not, create one by `touch .bash_profile`. Open your .bash_profile in your text editor and copy the following into the file:
  - `export MONGO_PATH=/usr/local/mongodb`
  - `export PATH=$PATH:$MONGO_PATH/bin`
7. Save .bash_profile and restart Terminal.
- Open 2 Terminal windows. On one, run `mongod`. Wait until the following message appear: `[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017`. "mongod" stands for Mongo Daemon, the host ***process*** for the database. Next, you will open a Mongo shell to ***access*** the database.
8. Keep the first window open with `mongod` still running. Switch to second terminal window, run `mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017`. This is your Mongo shell.

**Activity 2: Working with Database**
- In the shell, run `use techtonica`. Then run `show dbs`, which will list out the list of databases. What database is there? What is missing?

- The newly created database, "techtonica", should be missing. This is because the techtonica database is empty. Insert a document by running `db.classmates.insert({"name": "your_name", "month": your_birthmonth})`. Do it at least two more times with a friend's name. Remember not to double-quote the birth month to keep it as a digit instead of string.

- MongoDB stores documents in collections. Run `show collections`. What is already there? Can you guess at least where one of the collections came from?

- Run `db.createCollection("volunteer")`.

- View what's in each collection by running `db.classmates.find()` and `db.volunteers.find()`. What's the difference?

- Fix the empty volunteer collection by entering a document: `db.volunteers.insert({"volunteer": "Adrien"})` and `db.volunteers.insert({"volunteer": "Jamie"})`.

- Select a number between your birth month and your pair's birth month inside the classmates collection. Run `db.classmates.remove({"month": {$lt: the_number_your_selected}})`. The "$lt" means "less than." What do you think happened to the collections?

- Run `db.classmates.find()`. Were you correct?

- Run `db.volunteers.remove({})`, then `db.volunteers.find()`. What happened?

- Make sure you are in the techtonica database by running `use techtonica`. Make sure the output is `switched to db techtonica`. Then, you will delete the techtonica database by running `db.dropDatabase()`. The output should be `{ "dropped" : "techtonica", "ok" : 1 }`.

- Exit the shell by running `exit`. Next, go to the Terminal window running the Mongo Daemon, mongod. Exit the daemon by entering Ctrl C.

### Independent Practice

1. Sign up for [mLab](https://mlab.com) by following these directions: https://docs.mlab.com/
2. Follow [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/4yqu8YF29cU) for building a full Mongo project on your machine with an mLab online mongo database. This will take at least 2 hours, so settle in!  If you don't feel confident that you understand the parts of the project he is going over, stop the video and look up more examples.

### Challenge

"$lt" was used earlier to filter out which documents you deleted. MongoDB's documentation has a page on [Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/). What type of operator is "$lt"?

Operators can be used to only filter what you remove, or what you find. For example, `db.classmated.find({"month": {$lt: 6}})` will output anyone born before July (if you set your_birthmonth "July" as 6; because January is 0 in DateTime). You will be testing some of it next.

Open up the MongoDB daemon and shell again, create a database named "filterData". Create a collection named "zoo". Create at least 3 documents in the following format: `{"type": "lion", "name": "Suzy", "age": 10}`. Look at MongoDB's Operator page and find at least one operator other than Comparison Operator (which $lt was), and then test it out in the zoo collection.

### Check for Understanding

List out the steps to store data in MongoDB. Find a classmate. One of you will try to explain the steps by comparing it to organizing books, and the other will compare it to organizing kitchen utensils.
