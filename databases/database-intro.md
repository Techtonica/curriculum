# Intro to Databases

### Projected Time

35 minutes

### Lesson

This week you'll learn all about about databases. Databases are super important because they store the data for your application!
For example:

- For an online store, a database stores the items available, prices, and past orders.
- For a social media site, a database stores the user profiles, posts, and follows/friendships between users.

Databases let data persist in your application across multiple users and sessions.
