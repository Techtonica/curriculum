### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Install Node
- Run commands in Node's REPL
- Run a whole JavaScript file

### Check for Understanding

Explain to your pair of the day what the Node REPL is and why you might use it.

### Supplemental Materials

- Be aware of how to find [Node's API docs](https://nodejs.org/api/), and briefly familiarize yourself with its structure. You don't need to read it all now!
- Be aware that one way to install Node is by [downloading it directly from their website](https://nodejs.org/en/). However, we are not using this method; we're using nvm.
