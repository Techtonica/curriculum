# Getting Started with Node.js

### Projected Time

90 minutes

### Prerequisites

- [How the Internet Works](../requests-and-responses/requests-and-responses.md)
- [Intro to HTTP](/api/intro-to-http.md)

### Motivation

This lab exercise will introduce Node.js, a powerful tool that lets you run JavaScript outside of the browser, in your terminal or editor, or even to run servers.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Install Node
- Run commands in Node's REPL
- Run a whole JavaScript file

### Materials

- [Node.js official page](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- [NodeJS Tutorial for Absolute Beginners](https://youtu.be/U8XF6AFGqlc)

### Lesson

- [Node.js lecture slides (includes videos)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fMwUt4X5W5rps0jmThOT6iP1Ky3R8EBniPA4TY74jxQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Node.js video walkthrough of lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VYL7TRyFm4eIkXtgJa5QyeDR02jOW1l7/view?usp=sharing)

### Independent Practice

- [Node.js lab exercise, Part 1](/node-js/node-lab-exercise-part-1.md)

### Check for Understanding

After the lab exercise, participants should write down in their own words the steps they went through to create this basic web app using Node. It should be of good quality so they can refer to it later.

Participants should take turns in their pairs reading through and interpreting the `app.js` file line by line.

### Supplemental Materials

- Be aware of how to find [Node's API docs](https://nodejs.org/api/), and briefly familiarize yourself with its structure. You don't need to read it all now!
- Be aware that one way to install Node is by [downloading it directly from their website](https://nodejs.org/en/). However, we are not using this method; we're using nvm.
