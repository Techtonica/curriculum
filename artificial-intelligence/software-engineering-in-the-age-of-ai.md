## Lesson Activities

### Activity 1: AI Tool Exploration (60 minutes)

**Objective:** Gain hands-on experience with AI coding tools and develop critical evaluation skills.

**Self-Guided Practice (40 minutes):**

_Part 1: Basic Exploration (15 minutes)_

1. Select one of the following tasks:
   - Create a function to validate email addresses with specific requirements
   - Build a simple API endpoint that handles pagination
   - Implement a caching mechanism for expensive operations
2. Use your chosen AI tool to generate a solution, experimenting with at least 3 different prompting approaches
3. Document each prompt used and the resulting code
4. Note which prompt produced the best result and why you think it worked better

_Part 2: Critical Evaluation (15 minutes)_

1. Using the evaluation rubric, assess the best generated code for:
   - Correctness (Does it work as expected?)
   - Security (Are there any vulnerabilities?)
   - Performance (Are there inefficiencies?)
   - Readability (Is it well-documented and clear?)
   - Edge cases (What scenarios might break it?)
2. Identify at least 3 specific improvements needed
3. Score each aspect from 1-5 and note specific issues found

_Part 3: Code Improvement (10 minutes)_

1. Improve the code by:
   - Either manually editing the code to fix the identified issues
   - Or crafting a new prompt that addresses the identified issues
2. Document the improvements made and the reasoning behind them
3. Compare the original and improved versions

**Reflection (10 minutes):**

1. In your notebook, reflect on:
   - What surprised you about the AI's capabilities or limitations?
   - Which prompting techniques were most effective and why?
   - What types of issues did you consistently need to fix?
   - How might you integrate this tool into your workflow?
2. Create a personal list of "AI Tool Best Practices" based on your findings

**Evaluation Rubric Template:**

```plaintext
AI-Generated Code Evaluation

Task: [Description of the task]
AI Tool Used: [Tool name]
Prompt Used: [Your best prompt]

Criteria | Score (1-5) | Issues Found | Improvements Made
---------|-------------|--------------|------------------
Correctness | | |
Security | | |
Performance | | |
Readability | | |
Edge Case Handling | | |

Overall Assessment:
Strengths:
Weaknesses:
```

**Starter AI-Generated Code for Email Validation Task:**

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  // Simple regex to check if email is valid
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}

// Example usage
console.log(validateEmail('user@example.com')); // true
console.log(validateEmail('invalid-email')); // false
```

_⚠️ Note: This starter code has intentional limitations - it doesn't check for many edge cases, doesn't validate domain specifics, and uses a simplistic regex that could allow invalid emails._

### Activity 2: Problem-Solving Beyond AI (90 minutes)

   - User interactions (how do users engage with your solution?)
   - Technical considerations (what technologies would you use?)
2. Identify areas where AI tools could help implement the solution
3. Highlight aspects that would require human judgment or expertise
4. Note any trade-offs in your design and why you made those choices

**Reflection (10 minutes):**

1. In your notebook, reflect on:

   - What aspects of this problem would be difficult for AI to solve alone?
   - How did you handle ambiguity in the requirements?
   - What additional information would have been most valuable?
   - How might you approach similar ambiguous problems in the future?

2. Create a personal checklist for approaching ambiguous problems

## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

1. **Misconception: AI will completely replace software engineers.**

- Reality: AI is transforming the role of engineers, not eliminating it. The focus is shifting from writing every line of code to higher-level problem-solving, system design, and ensuring quality and security.

2. **Misconception: I need to compete with AI on coding speed and knowledge.**

- Reality: Your value as an engineer increasingly comes from skills AI lacks: creativity, contextual understanding, ethical judgment, and interpersonal collaboration.

3. **Misconception: Learning to code is becoming less valuable.**

- Reality: Understanding code remains essential, but the emphasis is shifting toward knowing how to evaluate, modify, and integrate code rather than writing everything from scratch.

4. **Misconception: Junior engineers will have no place in the industry.**

- Reality: Entry-level roles are evolving, not disappearing. Junior engineers who can effectively collaborate with AI tools while developing system-level thinking will be highly valuable.

5. **Misconception: AI tools always produce optimal code.**

- Reality: AI-generated code often requires significant human review and modification to address security concerns, performance issues, and specific business requirements.

6. **Misconception: Technical skills are all that matter.**

- Reality: As AI handles more routine coding tasks, human-centric skills like communication, collaboration, and business domain knowledge become increasingly important differentiators.

7. **Misconception: Once I learn to use AI tools, I'm set for my career.**

- Reality: Both AI capabilities and industry needs will continue evolving rapidly. Continuous learning and adaptability remain essential for long-term career success.
