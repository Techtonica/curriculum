# Assessment Objectives: A Grader's Guide

### How to Use
The files in the assessment-objectives folder each contain a checklist of the objectives for the apprentices' learning in the topics being assessed.

As an example, "0.md" contains the things apprentices should demonstrate in "Assessment #0". If an apprentice fails to demonstrate understanding, they should receive feedback from the grader that they need to put additional effort into meeting that objective.  In most cases, this will mean improving their submitted project, but otherwise the apprentice may be required to submit an additional code challenge or write-up to prove they've mastered the concept.
