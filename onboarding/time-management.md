## Motivation or Real-World Application
Time management is crucial for software engineers and for many of us as we navigate transitions and prioritize tasks in our daily lives. For those undergoing an intensive career change, mastering time management becomes even more essential. 

### Why Time Management Matters?
Improving your time management skills can help you:
- Stay on top of tasks and avoid falling behind
- Gaining more actual coding time
- Allocate more time for self-care

By managing your time effectively, you can achieve a better balance between work and personal well-being.

### Reducing our Gathering Points

In everyday life, we often accumulate tasks across various "gathering points" — places where you **gather** the things you need to do. These can include:

- Paper to-do lists
- Trello boards
- Desk piles
- Multiple inboxes
- Directories on your laptop
- Monday.com

The goal is to reduce the number of "gathering points" to as few as possible. Ideally, aim for just **3-6** key places.

You can find a more extensive list of gathering points [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm1t90aty8fc3ln/TMF_GatheringPoints.pdf?dl=0).

### Recommendations to Reduce Gathering Points:

- **Monday.com at Techtonica, or Jira at placements**  

- **One email inbox**  
  Forward all emails to one primary inbox to avoid fragmentation.

- **One physical "inbox"**  
  Create a dedicated space for physical tasks and set aside weekly time to process them.

- **One synced to-do list app**  
  Use a single app that syncs across devices to add tasks directly to 
- **Calendar**
