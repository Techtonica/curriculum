## Motivation or Real-World Application
Time management is crucial for software engineers and for many of us as we navigate transitions and prioritize tasks in our daily lives. For those undergoing an intensive career change, mastering time management becomes even more essential. 

### Why Time Management Matters?
Improving your time management skills can help you:
- Stay on top of tasks and avoid falling behind
- Gaining more actual coding time
- Allocate more time for self-care

By managing your time effectively, you can achieve a better balance between work and personal well-being.

### Reducing our Gathering Points

In everyday life, we often accumulate tasks across various "gathering points" — places where you **gather** the things you need to do. These can include:

- Paper to-do lists
- Trello boards
- Desk piles
- Multiple inboxes
- Directories on your laptop
- Monday.com

The goal is to reduce the number of "gathering points" to as few as possible. Ideally, aim for just **3-6** key places.

You can find a more extensive list of gathering points [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm1t90aty8fc3ln/TMF_GatheringPoints.pdf?dl=0).

### Recommendations to Reduce Gathering Points:

- **Monday.com at Techtonica, or Jira at placements**  

- **One email inbox**  
  Forward all emails to one primary inbox to avoid fragmentation.

- **One physical "inbox"**  
  Create a dedicated space for physical tasks and set aside weekly time to process them.

- **One synced to-do list app**  
  Use a single app that syncs across devices to add tasks directly to 
- **Calendar**

## Objectives

## Lesson 

What are some common challenges we face when trying to manage our time effectively? In this lesson, we'll explore the key issues that can arise and how to overcome them to stay on track.

### Prioritization Struggles

How will you remember to check your task list and calendar every day? Link it with an existing habit, such as:

- Sitting down at your computer
- Eating breakfast
- Brushing your teeth
- Putting on headphones

Some helpful tips to stay on top of your tasks:

- Set a regular time on your calendar to review your task list and stick to it.
- Remove distractions! Turn off phone notifications while working and set specific times to check them (e.g., morning, lunch, and evening) rather than constantly checking.

### Overcoming Decision Paralysis

If you're struggling to get started on a task, it’s often because you don’t know all the details and feel overwhelmed. Here’s a simple approach to break it down:

1. **Create a checklist** for each task outlining the "what," "when," "where," and manageable steps.

2. **For making decisions about tasks you’re stuck on:**  
   1. Articulate the problem.  
   2. List all possible solutions within a time limit.  
   3. Evaluate the pros and cons of each.  
   4. Rate each solution on a scale of 1-10.  
   5.  Implement the best option.

Sometimes, there won’t be an ideal solution, and you’ll just need to make a decision and move forward.

### Avoiding the "All or Nothing" Trap

It can be tempting to learn everything about a technical topic before starting a task or project. However, it’s often more effective to:

1. See what you can do, and then
2. Check out the resources you need to make more progress. 

This will help you avoid going too far into the available resources and give you a motivator.

If you're working in a team, **check in with others** to stay focused on your goals. Team standups are a great place to start.

### Optimizing Your Calendar
An effective calendar helps you stay organized, prioritize tasks, and balance work and personal time for increased productivity and well-being.

#### Benefits of an effective Calendar:
- **Ease of Mind**: Never forget an important event.
- **Declutter Your Mind**: Less to keep track of mentally.
- **Increase Confidence**: Tackle important tasks and schedule “me” time.
- **Become Aware of Your Time**: See how you’re spending your time.
- **Identify Priorities**: Notice what you’re over or under-prioritizing.
- **Have More Quality, Focused Days**: Stay flexible while staying productive.

#### Tips on how to make the best use of your Calendar:
- **Schedule in Your WRAP**: Make time for your WRAP to ensure balance and wellness.
- **Manage Self-Care**: Use your calendar to prioritize self-care. Feeling better helps you accomplish more with less stress. Avoid burnout by scheduling breaks.
- **Plan Your Meals**: Schedule your meals for the day. Plan ahead, so you can buy any missing ingredients, make better food choices, and save mental energy for important tasks like learning new coding topics.
- **Schedule Fun**: Include enjoyable activities throughout the week. Even 30 minutes dedicated to a hobby can help recharge you and bring joy.

### Tackling Procrastination

Why do people procrastinate? Here are some common reasons:

- Perfectionism/fear of negative evaluation
- The need for time pressure
- The issue seems overwhelming
- Difficulty finding a starting point
- A task is not appealing
- Wanting a big chunk of time

One key strategy for overcoming procrastination is to identify and challenge the unhelpful automatic thoughts that make tasks feel more overwhelming or unrealistic.

**Challenging Unhelpful Automatic Thinking**

Overcoming procrastination often involves challenging overly optimistic and unhelpful automatic thinking. These cognitive distortions can make tasks feel more daunting or unrealistic than they really are.


### Challenging Cognitive Distortions:

1. **Is this thought really true? What evidence or exceptions are there?**
2. **Is this thought helpful?**
3. **How else can I think about this?**
4. **What would I say to a friend in this situation?**
5. **Am I making assumptions or generalizations?**

### Example Situation: Working on a difficult ticket  

**Automatic thoughts**:  
- "I have to do all of this today." 
- "I must do it perfectly."
- "If I don’t finish, my boss will be mad."
- "If my work isn’t perfect and timely, my boss will be mad and I’ll be fired."

**Feelings and intensity (1-10)**: Assess the intensity range of your feelings. For example, an 8 could signify that you are overwhelmed or stressed.

**Cognitive distortions**:
- **All-or-nothing thinking**: "I have to finish everything at once. "
- **Catastrophizing**: "If I don’t do this perfectly, it's going to be a disaster."

**Rational response**:  
- *"It’s not the end of the world if I can’t do it all today. I can at least get started today and finish tomorrow if needed. I can ask my boss for help. My boss has been understanding in the past and could be again. I have received good feedback on other work, so it’s unlikely I’ll lose my job if this one isn’t perfect."*

##  Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
### Multitasking is a Myth!

Did you know that multitasking is actually a myth?

The costs of multitasking include:

- **Extra time:** Switching between tasks takes longer than you think.
- **Quality:** Trying to do too much at once lowers the quality of your work.
- **Stress:** Constant task-switching can create added stress.
