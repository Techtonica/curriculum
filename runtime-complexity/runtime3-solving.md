## Runtime Exercise 3: Designing algorithms and writing code

How would you solve the following problems?
Can you think of an O(n^2), O(n log n), and O(n) solution to each problem?
If you have time, code one of the functions you thought of to solve the problem.

### Find the integer that occurs most frequently in an array

Examples:

- `[1,4,5,4,2,2,4]` returns `4`

### Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the greatest difference you can get by subtracting any two of those numbers.

Examples:

- `[1, 5, 3, 1, 15]` returns `14`

### Find the only element in an array that only occurs once

Examples:

- `[3,5,3,4,6,6,4]` returns `5`

### Find the common elements of 2 integer arrays

Examples:

- `([1,3,2,5], [3,9,8,1])` returns `[1, 3]`

### Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams (use the same letters re-arranged)

Examples:

- `("cat", "act")` returns `true`
- `("at", "tat")` returns `false`
- `("cat", "dog")` returns `false`

### Check if a String is composed of all unique characters

Examples:

- `"banana"` returns `false`
- `"bacon"` returns `true`
