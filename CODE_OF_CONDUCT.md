Last modified: 11 September 2016

## Mission

Techtonica’s mission is to make every engineering team as diverse as its local community while empowering low-income women and non-binary adults through tech training and careers.

### Short Form Code of Conduct

Techtonica is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all members and guests, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, or religion (or lack thereof). Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication. We do not tolerate harassment in any form and we prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.
