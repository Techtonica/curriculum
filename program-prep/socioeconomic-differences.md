# Socioeconomic Differences

### Projected Time

Total - 1 hour
Lesson - 23 minutes
Check for Understanding - 30-40 minutes

### Prerequisites

None

### Motivation

A person's socioeconomic status can inform their identity, as it affects the community around them and their lived experiences. Therefore, there are some shared experiences among people who come from blue-collar backgrounds and move to white-collar jobs. The experience can be unsettling, and feel alienating at times, as it might be hard to understand a different workplace environment, and experience potentially negative responses from people around them. The purpose of covering this topic is to help people recognize what might cause those feelings, and be able to address them when they arise.

### Objectives

Participants will be able to:

- Anticipate certain pitfalls and aversions that come with belonging to a certain socioeconomic class
- Learn the value of social capital and importance of asking for help from their fellow colleagues and seniors.
- Learn that it’s normal for white-collar professionals to want reasons behind tasks and therefore one must not panic but rather give an appropriate reason for the decision.

### Specific Things to Learn

- The term "class straddler"
- The value of social capital
- The priority of networking
