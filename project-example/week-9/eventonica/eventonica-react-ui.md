# Eventonica - Build a React UI

## Projected Time

4-6 Hours

## Primary Goal

To build a UI for a portfolio-ready client-side application.

## Overview

You'll build a web UI for the Eventonica app that will allow a user to interact with the code you already wrote in Part 1. This will be the basis of the subsequent parts as well.

In this tutorial, we will create:

- a form for creating a user with an email
- callback function for deleting a user
- a list to display all users

### References

- [React Outlines](/react-js)

### Goals

You'll use React and JavaScript to build functionality for all the features listed in the [main project README](./README.md#project-requirements).

By the end of this lesson, your project will have:

1. A user list
2. A form to create a user
3. A callback function to delete a user

By the end of this project, your project will also:

1. Have a README
2. Have CSS to customize the look
3. All the features listed in the main [Eventonica README](./README.md)

## UI Instructions

Remember to commit your code and push to GitHub frequently while working on this project. A good rule of thumb is whenever a new piece of functionality is working, commit with a descriptive message.

### Create Your First Subcomponents

Before we create some components from scratch, your first challenge is to abstract an existing element into a new file, then export it as a component.

It's typical for a React developer to start in one file, then begin to divide it into new files and components as things grow. This keeps things organized and easy to read. There seems to be a general agreement that files should not be over 200 or 300 lines long, but of course there are plenty of opinions.

1. Create a new folder in `client/src` named `components`. Create a file called `Footer.jsx` within `components`.

Having a folder called `components` will be useful because in the future, we can have other folders such as `apis` or `utils`. Separating concerns in a project is a good practice because it makes the files and folders easier to read and navigate.

2. Copy all the code from `<footer>` to `</footer>` in `App.js` and paste it into `components/Footer.jsx`.

3. Use your knowledge of React to convert this to a component named `Footer` that is exported from `components/Footer.jsx` back to its original position in `App.js`. You can do it!

4. Follow the same step for creating `components/Header.jsx` file. Copy the header section code from `App.js` and paste it in `Header.jsx` file. Don't forget to import calendar icon.

### Users Subcomponent

Before this stage, ensure you have a commit in place with the working app.

### Display All Users

1. Copy the code in `App.js` in the `<section className="user-management">` section. Create a new file in the `components` file called `Users.jsx`, and paste the code in `Users.jsx`. This section should be deleted from `App.js` once it is in `Users.jsx`. Make sure your file looks like this:

```js
import React from 'react';

function Users() {
  return <section className="user-management">........</section>;
}

export default Users;
```

Use this `Users` component in `App.js` and check that the section is rendering correctly.

2. Lets create an array of mockUsers in `Users.jsx`

```js
const mockUsers = [
  { name: "Marlin", email: "marlin@gmail.com", id: "1" },
  { name: "Nemo", email: "nemo@gmail.com", id: "2" },
  { name: "Dory", email: "dory@gmail.com", id: "3" },
];

function Users() {
  ......
```

In the future, this list will come from a database. For now, we'll store hard-coded users inside our Users component. Note that we use `const`, not `let`. Remember that props are read-only and that we can't change them.

### Displaying Users

1. Use `useState` to create `users` and `setUsers`. The default value for `users` can be a list of your mock users.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

const mockUsers = [  { ... },...
];

function Users() {
 const [users, setUsers] = useState(mockUsers);
  ......
```

2. Next, we'll add a loop to list all users. In JSX, we use the map() function for loops.

```jsx
function Users() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState(mockUsers);
  return (
    .......
        <tbody>
          {users.map((user) => (
            <tr key={user.id}>
              <td>{user.id}</td>
              <td>{user.name}</td>
              <td>{user.email}</td>
              <td>
                <button>Edit</button>
              </td>
              <td>
                <button>Delete</button>
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    .......
```

Note that we added a `key value` to each user. For more information, check out the ["Recursing on Children" section of the React Reconciliation Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children).

### Adding a User

1. Update the HTML form under "Add User" to have an ID field and an email field.

<!-- 2. There are four main things that we need to have to make our forms work:

    - A state (so we will need to employ the useState() hook)
    - Our form component with an input value that is assigned to the correct variable
    - A function that handles the stateâ€™s changes
    - A function to handle the form submission -->

2. As the user types in the input fields, we will need to store what value is in each field. Example:

```js
const values = { name: '', email: '', id: null };
const [inputValues, setInputValues] = useState(values);
```

Every time the user types a input in the input field, the `values` state is updated. How can we achieve this?

Hint: Input elements have a `value` property that contains the current input, [see example at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_text_value.asp).

Your input field could look something like this:

```js
<input
  type="text"
  name="name"
  id="add-user-name"
  value={inputValues.name}
  // later we need to work on OnChange event handler
  onChange={handleChange}
/>
```

Do the same thing for the ID and email fields.

#### Event Handling

With JS DOM, you would attach event handlers to the DOM. In React, you should not be doing any direct DOM manipulation (ie `document.getElementById`, setting `innerHTML`, etc)

See the example code below to compare Vanilla JS vs React (this example code may not be exactly how your code works but hopefully you can see how to apply the idea to yours)

**JS DOM Example of Handling a "Create User" Action**

```js
let users = [];
document
  .querySelector('#add-user-action')
  .addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const newId = parseInt(document.querySelector('#new-user-id').value);
    const newName = document.querySelector('#new-user-name').value;
    const newUser = { id: newId, name: newName };
    users.push(newUser);
    displayEvents(); // calls another function to refresh the DOM after users is updated
  });
```

**In React we would setup the event handler like this:**

```jsx
// id, name, and email are states that store what values the user types in those fields
// users is an array of user objects
// All of these states can be defined in the component
const handleAddSubmit = (e) => {
  // Prevent browser refreshing after form submission
  e.preventDefault();
  const newUser = {
    id: inputValues.id,
    name: inputValues.name,
    email: inputValues.email
  };
  setUsers([...users, newUser]);
};
```

Don't forget to add an event handler in the `onSubmit` attribute for the `<form>`.

Next, work on `onChange` event handler. OnChange is a prop that you can pass into JSX <input> element, sp that your application can listen to user in in real-time

```jsx
const handleChange = (e) => {
  const value = e.target.value;
  setValues({
    ...inputValues,
    [e.target.name]: value
  });
};
```

Open your application in a web browser. Enter user name, email and id. Click the submit button. You will see the user data in table.

Bonus: after creating a new user, you might see that the input fields still have the values filled in. How can you update the submit function so that the input values are reset after pressing "submit"?

**JS Syntax Checks**:
Take a look at some of the object and array syntax in the code snippet above. Do you understand what `[...users, newUser]` represents?

### Delete User

Here we are going to create the function we want to fire on a button click to remove a user data from our users array.

```jsx

const deleteUser = (deleteId) => {
  // here we are filtering - the idea is remove user from the users array on a button click
  const removeUser = users.filter((user) => {
    // return the rest of the users that don't match the user we are deleting

   return user.id !== deleteId)};
   // removeUser returns a new array - so now we are setting the users to the new array
  setUsers(removeUser);
};
```

Finally add `onClick` event handler to a button. When the button is clicked, deleteUser(user.id) will be executed. Once again, we need to use () => in our JSX curly braces because our function has parenthesis with an argument.

### Reusing Components:

We are almost ready to add update functionality to our application, but before we do, we have an opportunity to think about code reusability. Currently, our `Users` component uses a form. We will need to build an EditUserForm that will use a form with the exact same fields. In fact, we can potentially use almost the exact same form for both components. Instead of copying the code into both components (which isn't DRY), let's extract some of that code into a component called `UserForm`.

**Challenge**: Let's refactor the code by moving form to different component called `UserForm.jsx`. Pass `values and handleSubmit` as a prop from `User.jsx` to `UserForm.jsx`.

### Update User

- Updating a user is a bit more difficult than adding or deleting a user. Here we are going to reuse `UserForm.jsx` file.

- In `User.jsx` file use `useState` function to check if the user is currently editing and to decide which user is currently being edited:

```jsx
const [isEditingUser, setIsEditingUser] = useState(false);
// object state to set so we know which user we are editing
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(values);
```

- Next we are going to re-format JSX

  - We need to check if we are in editing mode
  - If we are editing, then display the editing form
  - If we are not editing, then display the add user form
  - The editing form has a couple additional buttons so the user can control what they would like to do

  ```jsx
  function Users() {
    return (
      <section className="user-management">
        <!--  user list table goes here -->

         <!--  conditional rendering -->
        {isEditingUser ? (

          <UserForm
          handleSubmit={handleEditSubmit}
          values={currentUser}
          buttonText="Update"
        />
      ) : (
        <UserForm
          handleSubmit={handleAddSubmit}
          values={values}
          buttonText="Add" />
        )}
      </section>
    );
  }
  ```

- In user table we have `Edit` button, if we click edit button, it should redirect to form

- In order to update the user data, we need user id. Lets create a function called editUser. Bind it to Edit button. We also need to pass the data as a parameter.

```jsx
<td>
  <button onClick={() => editUser(user)}>Edit</button>
</td>
```

- Lets create a edit user function

```jsx
const editUser = (user) => {
  console.log(user);
  // set editing to true
  setIsEditingUser(true);
  // set the currentUser to the user that was clicked
  // setCurrentUser({ id: user.id, name: user.name, username: user.username })
  setCurrentUser({ ...user });
};
```

- Let's create the actual function that will get called when the edit form is submitted. Unlike delete (which filters a user out by ID) or add (which appends a user to the array), the update function needs to map through the array, and update the user that matches the ID passed through.

- This means we'll be taking two parameters - the updated user object, and the id - and we'll use a ternary operation to map through the users and find the one we want to update.

```jsx
const updateUser = (id, updatedUser) =>
  setUsers(users.map((user) => (user.id === id ? updatedUser : user)));

const handleEditSubmit = (updatedUser) => {
  updateUser(currentUser.id, updatedUser);
  setCurrentUser({
    id: null,
    name: '',
    email: ''
  });
  setIsEditingUser(false);
};
```

- Lets make some changes in `handleSubmit` function and `UserForm.jsx` file. So that we can use same form.

```jsx
const handleAddSubmit = (newUser) => {
  setUsers([...users, newUser]);
};
```

- Finally our `UserForm.jsx` file something that looks like this:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function UserForm({ handleSubmit, values, buttonText }) {
  const [inputValues, setInputValues] = useState(values);

  useEffect(() => {
    setInputValues(values);
  }, [values]);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    console.log('new value', e.target.value);
    const value = e.target.value;
    setInputValues({
      ...inputValues,
      [e.target.name]: value
    });
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <form
        id="add-user"
        action="#"
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          // updated code
          e.preventDefault();
          handleSubmit(inputValues);
        }}
      >
        <fieldset>
          <label htmlFor="add-user-name">Name</label>
          <input
            type="text"
            name="name"
            id="add-user-name"
            value={inputValues.name}
            onChange={handleChange}
          /> <br />
          <br />
          <label htmlFor="add-user-email">Email</label>
          <input
            type="text"
            name="email"
            id="add-user-email"
            value={inputValues.email}
            onChange={handleChange}
          />{' '}
          <br /> <br />
          <label htmlFor="add-user-id">Id</label>
          <input
            type="number"
            name="id"
            id="add-user-id"
            value={inputValues.id}
            onChange={handleChange}
          />
        </fieldset>

        <input type="submit" value={buttonText} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserForm;
```

- Have to noticed, we used the `useEffect` hook
  to update the state of a component when its props change. For more information check out [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54865764/react-usestate-does-not-reload-state-from-props)

**Challenge:** Move your user list data(table) into a separate component called `UserList.jsx`.

- Feel free to check all our component

```jsx
// User.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

import UserList from './UserList';
import UserForm from './UserForm';

const mockUsers = [
  { name: 'Marlin', email: 'marlin@gmail.com', id: '1' },
  { name: 'Nemo', email: 'nemo@gmail.com', id: '2' },
  { name: 'Dory', email: 'dory@gmail.com', id: '3' }
];

function Users() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState(mockUsers);

  const values = { name: '', email: '', id: '' };

  const [isEditingUser, setIsEditingUser] = useState(false);

  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(values);

  const handleAddSubmit = (newUser) => {
    setUsers([...users, newUser]);
  };

  const deleteUser = (deleteId) => {
    const removeUser = users.filter((user) => {
      return user.id !== deleteId;
    });

    setUsers(removeUser);
  };

  const editUser = (user) => {
    setIsEditingUser(true);
    setCurrentUser({ ...user });
  };

  const updateUser = (id, updatedUser) => {
    setUsers(users.map((user) => (user.id === id ? updatedUser : user)));
  };

  const handleEditSubmit = (updatedUser) => {
    updateUser(currentUser.id, updatedUser);
    setCurrentUser(values);
    setIsEditingUser(false);
  };
  return (
    <section className="user-management">
      <h2>User Management</h2>

      <UserList users={users} editUser={editUser} deleteUser={deleteUser} />

      {isEditingUser ? (
        <UserForm
          handleSubmit={handleEditSubmit}
          values={currentUser}
          buttonText="Update"
        />
      ) : (
        <UserForm
          handleSubmit={handleAddSubmit}
          values={values}
          buttonText="Add"
        />
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default Users;
```

```jsx
// UserList.jsx
function UserList({ users, editUser, deleteUser }) {
  return (
    <table id="users">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Id</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Email Address</th>
          <th>Edit</th>
          <th>Delete</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <tr key={user.id}>
            <td>{user.id}</td>
            <td>{user.name}</td>
            <td>{user.email}</td>
            <td>
              <button onClick={() => editUser(user)}>Edit</button>
            </td>
            <td>
              <button onClick={() => deleteUser(user.id)}>Delete</button>
            </td>
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
}

export default UserList;
```

**Check for understanding:**

- Notice `preventDefault` used in the sample code -- Comment it out and see what happens. Learn more about it from the [preventDefault MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)
