# Eventonica - React Testing Library

### Primary Goals

- Practice writing tests with RTL
- Practice implementing a Jest snapshot
- Catch any bugs in your project's React code

### Overview

Now that you've written Jest tests to cover your frontend logic, you'll write React Testing Library tests to ensure your components work as expected.

### Instructions for adding tests

1. Take a look at the React components that make up the Events section of your page. Write down 6 things from this section that a user should expect to see, or how they can expect something to behave.
2. Your challenge is to write an RTL test for each of these listed items.
3. Write at least one Jest snapshot test that tests a component in this section.
