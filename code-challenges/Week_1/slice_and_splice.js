/*

You are given two arrays and an index. Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order. Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array. Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.

Examples
frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], 1) should return [4, 1, 2, 3, 5].

frankenSplice([1, 2], ["a", "b"], 1) should return ["a", 1, 2, "b"].

frankenSplice(["claw", "tentacle"], ["head", "shoulders", "knees", "toes"], 2) should return ["head", "shoulders", "claw", "tentacle", "knees", "toes"].

frankenSpice([1, 2, 3], [], 1) should return [1, 2, 3]

All elements from the first array should be added to the second array in their original order. frankenSplice([1, 2, 3, 4], [], 0) should return [1, 2, 3, 4].
The first array should remain the same after the function runs.
The second array should remain the same after the function runs.
