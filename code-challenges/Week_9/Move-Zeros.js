/*
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example 1:					
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]		
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]			

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Challenge: Can you write your answer without making a copy of the array. Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
