/*
Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:						Example 2:
Input: num = 38				Input: num = 0
Output: 2						  Output: 0
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Challenge: Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
