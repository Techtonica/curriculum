// Given an array arr[] of size N-1 with integers in the range of [1, N], the task is to find the missing number from the first N integers. There are no duplicates in the list.

// Example 1:
// Input: arr[] =
// {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}, N = 8
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5

// Example 2:
// Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}, N = 5
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The missing number between 1 to 5 is 4
