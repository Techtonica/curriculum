Participants will be provided a prompted code-challenge. Work on it for 20 minutes! Your code challenge block will be used to go over any questions you may have. Every week you will [screen record](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWUXCqAlOBhyhp5Mg5bkB-78O64tPztU5miDOMQ_unM/edit?usp=sharing) a single code-challenge in addition to your [Yoodli](https://yoodli.ai/) core skills review. That’s two recordings each week! You will receive feedback at the beginning of the following week.

🎗️ **Remember** 🎗️

- The purpose of these exercises are to get you comfortable with your technical interviewing process
- You should be solving your problem for the first time when engaging in these code challenges. Even if it's a [brute force solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/brute-force-approach-and-its-pros-and-cons/).
- Any stated "challenges" sections in your code problems should be completed after you have resolve each of the code challenge's core objectives.

⚠️ Remember, the purpose of this exercise is to get you comfortable with technical interviews - you should be solving your problem for the first time while on the recording! Even if it's a [brute force solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/brute-force-approach-and-its-pros-and-cons/).

Lastly, for your core skills mock interviews, challenge yourself to not have scripted answers! Do NOT write your answers down and read them off. You can definitely go through the exercise of practicing answering questions, but then put those written answers away while you are interviewing. In most real world interviews, you won't always have the chance to write your answers out in advance of an interview. Challenge yourself to answer these questions in the moment so that you can really practice what it's like to organically collect your thoughts and think on the spot! That said, you can have your two employer questions written down. In fact, it is good practice to have a list of questions to ask the interviewer; you are thinking through which questions to ask, to develop your list!

### 💡 Mondays will be used to review feedback

Mondays will be used to review the feedback of your recorded session from the previous week. Consider and rework your answers to incorporate any actionable changes.

### 🧠 How to Solve Code Challenges

Review the [lesson](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/solving-coding-challenges/solving-coding-challenges.md) on how to address problem-solving technical questions. Practice in your own time with this code challenge.

### 🧑‍💻 Live Weekly Code Challenges

To better assess who needs technical support and intervention earlier in the program, participants will engage in live weekly code challenges with program staff. This will provide a more interactive and supportive environment for your learning.

### Tips for Success

- Be sure you are sharing your entire screen and including staff in on your research - this is another part of including them in on your thought process.
- As you approach later weeks of the curriculum, you should focus on using less resources to problem solve. You won't always be able to use google or external resources when interviewing.
- What edge cases would you consider?
- If something in your prompt is unclear to you, that is something that you should explicitly ask about or state an assumption.
- A major part of these technical interviews, beyond knowing how to code and having methods memorized, is showing that you can communicate - so walk through your thought processes and share them with the interviewer.
