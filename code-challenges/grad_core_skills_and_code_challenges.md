# Continued Education Grad Check-In: Core Skills & Code Challenges

Meet with your fellow graduates each week. Each week you meet we go over two prompts: one soft skills and one code challenge. You will have time to write out your responses and get real-time feedback on your soft skills; then we will work through a problem-solving code challenge together.

### Things to Discuss Each Accountability Session

- How are you?
- What are you proud of?
- Do you need advice or need support with anything?
- Have you learned anything useful you might want to share with everyone else?
- Continuing to meet with mentors
- Techtonica updates (when applicable)
