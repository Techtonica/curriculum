# CSS

### Projected Time

About 4.5 hours
- 27 minutes for video walkthrough of CSS slides
- 10 minutes for video walkthrough of CSS-Part 2 slides
- 3.5 hours for Independent Practice (Project)

### Prerequisites

"HTML" lesson

### Motivation

- Cascading style sheets(CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
- CSS enables the separation of presentation and content and this separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility, reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
- It can completely control how your web pages look without changing your HTML. It's an important language for front-end and full-stack web developers to know because today it is used in all webpages.

 **Which companies use CSS?** Everyone. Some companies with very beautiful sites are [Uber](https://www.uber.com) and [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/).
 
 **Looking at an example website**
-  Have you ever noticed why some websites look so appealing?
- Go to [wildrenfrew.com](https://wildrenfrew.com/) and see how unique this website is?
- Some sections in this site are marvelous.
- The website is a complete package of correct font, color, images, and video which all enhances its beauty.

### Things to Remember

- **You need some HTML code before you can add styling with CSS.**

- **HTML and CSS are two different languages.** Though commonly referred to together as "HTML/CSS", these are two distinct languages that do completely different things. They work really well together.

- **There are specificity rules in CSS.** You need to understand these rules so you can work within them to produce the styling you want.


### Independent Practice

No pairs will be assigned for this project, but you should rely on your classmates for help once you've spent 20 minutes working independently through something you're stuck on.

The activity for the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery lessons is a project that allows you to combine your new skills in each of these areas.

### Check for Understanding

Instructor will do a code review with each apprentice once they've completed the CSS portion of the project.
