# Tech Industry Tips

### IRC/Other Help Channels

- Things move quickly and people get annoyed if you ask for permission before asking a question. It may seem really straightforward and possibly rude to you, but just ask the question. (No, "Can someone help me with a React question?" Instead, "This function is getting this error, and this is what I've looked up and tried so far. What am I missing?") 
- When asking a question, provide all of the context you think someone might need in order to help. You'll have more luck in finding help if someone has all the information they need to help.

### Email

- Make sure your email is set to automatically reply all so you don't leave people out, but when responding to a mailing list message.
- If you get the same email repeatedly, set up a canned response to save yourself time.
- Don’t use Yahoo mail; people will judge you.
- Send links to Dropbox or Google Docs instead of clogging up people's inboxes with attachments.
- Make sure to always do the double-opt-in introduction: ask both sides for permission before making an introduction.
- To avoid starting new email threads (and thus lose context) when someone needs to be removed from a thread (an introducer, for example), move them to BCC. You can accompany this with, "Thanks, Jane! Moving you to BCC to spare your inbox."
- Anything you write in an email, assume it will be forwarded to everyone in the company, and quoted in the New York Times. If you have something to say and you don't want to be held accountable for it, find the person and say it in person. This is a common tactic for HR departments.
- Don't leave your email open, and don't become interrupt-driven from it.
  "Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things." - [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html)

### Slack

- @-mention people when responding to their messages in channels, or respond in a thread so they receive a notification (there are a lot of Slacks and the busiest people will appreciate that you brought them back to that conversation).
- Instead of writing, "Thanks," or "Got it," or, "Okay," use emojis (like a thumbs up) for short responses that don't add a lot of meaning to the messaging.
- @here will notify everyone who has slack open. It might be appropriate for something like "@here it's time for our meeting!"
- @channel will notify everyone and send a notification to their phone. Use it for emergencies like "@channel our website is being hacked."

### Twitter

- Starting a tweet with someone's user name will create a public message to that account rather than creating a really public tweet. If you want a tweet to be public but want to start with a user name, just put a . in front.

### Technologies

- Learn as many keyboard shortcuts as you can so mentors don't get impatient while watching you move back and forth between the keyboard and your mouse or trackpad.
- Don’t use Word or other non-cloud software for docs that others may need to edit. Use Google Docs.
- [Typeset your resume in LaTeX](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=56). The [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern) font will be instantly recognizable.
- Download [the Video Speed Controller Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk) to watch videos faster or slower (this is especially helpful with fast-moving tutorials).


### Professionalism

- Don't introduce people to each other without asking both sides for permission first.
- Don't use text-speak in your messaging. ("cu b4 the party" is a no-no.)
- Keep your LinkedIn updated with a good picture (you can use [Photofeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com/) to get other people's feedback).
- If you can't make it to an event you signed up for, let the organizers know.
- Connect with people you've met at events on LinkedIn within a week. Two days is better.
- Most people in tech no longer provide phone numbers, and calls should be pre-arranged. Video calls are preferred by many (use Zoom, Google Meet, BlueJeans, etc.). Do not take calls in open offices—find a private room.


### Random

- It's generally a good idea to look in a shared drive or google something before asking someone.
