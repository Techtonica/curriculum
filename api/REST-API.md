### Motivation

REST completely changed software engineering after 2000. This new approach to developing web projects and services was defined by Roy Fielding, father of the HTTP specification and one of the leading international authorities on everything to do with Network Architecture, in his dissertation entitled "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures". In the field of APIs, REST (Representational State Transfer) is today the "be all and end all" in service app development.
Today there are no projects or applications that don't have a REST API for the creation of professional services based on this software. Twitter, YouTube, Facebook identification systems… hundreds of companies generate business thanks to REST and REST APIs. Without them any horizontal growth would be practically impossible. This is because REST is the most logical, efficient and widespread standard in the creation of APIs for Internet services.

### Lesson

To give a simple definition, REST is any interface between systems using HTTP to obtain data and generate operations on those data in all possible formats, such as XML and JSON. This is an increasingly popular alternative to other standard data exchange protocols such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which have a high capacity but are also very complex. Sometimes it's preferable to use a simpler data-processing solution such as REST. 

**REST's Features:**
  - Stateless client/server protocol: each HTTP contains all the necessary information to run it, which means that neither the client nor the server need to remember any previous state to satisfy it. Be that as it may, some HTTP applications incorporate a cache memory. This configures what is known as the stateless client-cache-server protocol: it is possible to define some of the responses to specific HTTP requests as cachable, so the client can run the same response for identical requests in the future. However, the fact that the option exists doesn't mean it is the most recommended.
  
**Guiding Principles of Rest:**
 - Client–server – By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.
 - Stateless – Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.
 - Cacheable – Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.
 - Uniform interface – By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state.
  - Layered system – The layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior such that each component cannot “see” beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting.
  - Code on demand (optional) – REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented.
  
There are four very important data transactions in any REST system and HTTP specification: POST (create), GET (read and consult), PUT (edit) and DELETE.
 - HTTP POST
    - Use POST APIs to create new subordinate resources, e.g. a file is subordinate to a directory containing it or a row is subordinate to a database table. Talking strictly in terms of REST, POST methods are used to create a new resource into the collection of resources.Ideally, if a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be HTTP response code 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header.Many times, the action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either HTTP response code 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status.
Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields.
Please note that POST is neither safe nor idempotent and invoking two identical POST requests will result in two different resources containing the same information (except resource ids).
 - HTTP GET
   - Use GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only – and not to modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods. Additionally, GET APIs should be idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests must produce the same result every time until another API (POST or PUT) has changed the state of the resource on the server.
If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.
For any given HTTP GET API, if the resource is found on the server then it must return HTTP response code 200 (OK) – along with response body which is usually either XML or JSON content (due to their platform independent nature).
In case resource is NOT found on server then it must return HTTP response code 404 (NOT FOUND). Similarly, if it is determined that GET request itself is not correctly formed then server will return HTTP response code 400 (BAD REQUEST).
 - HTTP PUT
   - Use PUT APIs primarily to update existing resource (if the resource does not exist then API may decide to create a new resource or not). If a new resource has been created by the PUT API, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the HTTP response code 201 (Created) response and if an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.
If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.
The difference between the POST and PUT APIs can be observed in request URIs. POST requests are made on resource collections whereas PUT requests are made on an individual resource.
 - HTTP DELETE
   - As the name applies, DELETE APIs are used to delete resources (identified by the Request-URI).
A successful response of DELETE requests SHOULD be HTTP response code 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has been queued, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been performed but the response does not include an entity.DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it’s removed from the collection of resource. Repeatedly calling DELETE API on that resource will not change the outcome – however calling DELETE on a resource a second time will return a 404 (NOT FOUND) since it was already removed. Some may argue that it makes DELETE method non-idempotent. It’s a matter of discussion and personal opinion.
If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.

 Objects in REST are always manipulated from the URI. It is the URI and no other element that is the sole identifier of each resource in this REST system. The URI allows us to access the information in order to change or delete it, or for example to share its exact location with third parties.  
 
 **Advantages of REST for developement:**
  - Separation between the client and the server: the REST protocol totally separates the user interface from the server and the data storage. This has some advantages when making developments. For example, it improves the portability of the interface to other types of platforms, it increases the scalability of the projects, and allows the different components of the developments to be evolved independently.
  - Visibility, reliability and scalability. The separation between client and server has one evident advantage, and that is that each development team can scale the product without too much problem. They can migrate to other servers or make all kinds of changes in the database, provided the data from each request is sent correctly. The separation makes it easier to have the front and the back on different servers, and this makes the apps more flexible to work with.
  -  The REST API is always independent of the type of platform or languages: the REST API always adapts to the type of syntax or platforms being used, which gives considerable freedom when changing or testing new environments within the development. With a REST API you can have PHP, Java, Python or Node.js servers. The only thing is that it is indispensable that the responses to the requests should always take place in the language used for the information exchange, normally XML or JSON.
