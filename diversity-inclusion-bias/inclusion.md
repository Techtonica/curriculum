Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Build on the first information. Have participants guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:
- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

This is something that participants might not realize or might assume at first.

Make sure they avoid this: thing


### Guided Practice

Have the participants work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Take an Implicit Association Test (IAT) here (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) to identify what your unconscious biases are!

There are multiple topics to choose from: Age, Gender, Sexuality, Skin-tone, Ethnicity, etc. 

Remember: Awareness is the first step to combatting bias.

### Check for Understanding

Have participants summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
