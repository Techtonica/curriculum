## Motivation

In a [recent study](https://www.business2community.com/human-resources/how-to-design-a-workspace-that-boosts-employee-motivation-02222288), research company IPSOS, discovered that a workspace focused on employee happiness is a powerful driver for productivity.

The IPSOS study showcases the urgent need for more engaging workspaces:

- 85% of workers feel they don’t work in a space where they can share ideas
- 87% feel there isn’t a place to work in teams
- 84% don’t feel a sense of belonging or a willingness to be a part of company culture

## Lesson

The workplace is the location at which an employee provides work for an employer. That seems like a simple enough explanation, but it can become a bit more complex, especially in today's knowledge economy.

**What an Employee Needs to Know**

Your employer gets to choose your workplace. Generally, as long as they follow health and safety regulations, your employer can make what might seem like unreasonable demands. Some office spaces are large, and each employee has his or her own private office. It's more likely, though, that you have a cubicle or even share a table with other coworkers. If you prefer to work alone, your employer can say, “no, this is your assigned space.”

**Some of the suggestions which can be implemented in order to ensure a healthy and positive work environment are:**

1. Respect headphones as an indicator of busyness
2. Find a quiet corner if you want to focus
3. Intentionally spend some amount of time without headphones on so others can approach you
4. Send "slack warnings" if you are going to come interrupt someone to reduce surprise
