Other example article(20 min read) - Answer the 3 questions at the end. (Be sure to explain how to use these materials in directions in one of the sections below (ie: lesson, guided practice). If you are not assigning them somehow, they should be placed under Supplemental Materials at the bottom.)
## Lesson
Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Be sure to link the slideshow, video,
or other materials you expect them to follow as part of the lesson.
Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

## Common Mistakes & Misconceptions
List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

## Guided Practice
Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step. This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.

## Independent Practice
Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it's less guided, more independent.

## Challenge
Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they've learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.

## Check for Understanding
Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps them self-assess their understanding. This exercise should help apprentices determine whether they've met the outline objectives, or if they need to review.
