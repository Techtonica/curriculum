## Motivation

In a [recent study](https://www.business2community.com/human-resources/how-to-design-a-workspace-that-boosts-employee-motivation-02222288), research company IPSOS, discovered that a workspace focused on employee happiness is a powerful driver for productivity.

The IPSOS study showcases the urgent need for more engaging workspaces:

- 85% of workers feel they don’t work in a space where they can share ideas
- 87% feel there isn’t a place to work in teams
- 84% don’t feel a sense of belonging or a willingness to be a part of company culture

## Lesson

The workplace is the location at which an employee provides work for an employer. That seems like a simple enough explanation, but it can become a bit more complex, especially in today's knowledge economy.

**What an Employee Needs to Know**

Your employer gets to choose your workplace. Generally, as long as they follow health and safety regulations, your employer can make what might seem like unreasonable demands. Some office spaces are large, and each employee has his or her own private office. It's more likely, though, that you have a cubicle or even share a table with other coworkers. If you prefer to work alone, your employer can say, “no, this is your assigned space.”

**Some of the suggestions which can be implemented in order to ensure a healthy and positive work environment are:**
1.  Arrive early. You will be remembered for answering your phone at 8:01 a.m. in a world where tardiness is common.
2.  Network with people outside of your cubicle. A perk of having a job at a company you appreciate is meeting other people with similar interests who share advice from their past experiences.
3.  Do bring in goodies. Who doesn’t love to eat? If you have free time one night, bake cookies or brownies and bring them to work. Everyone will love you.
4.  Create a proper personal email address. Depending on your profession, you will most likely have to correspond with your coworkers after work and on weekends. Replace “foxychick123” with a professional username, such as your first initial and last name.
5.  Jump at the chance to complete a new task. Your coworkers likely gave it to you because they have confidence in your abilities, not because they have time to dish out busy work.
6.  Be flexible. Sometimes a project calls for earlier or later hours; be OK with adjusting your schedule accordingly.
7.  Keep an eye on your personal budget. Just because you have an income now doesn’t mean you should “make it rain” all in one place. Invest in your future.
8.  Respect headphones as an indicator of busyness
9.  Find a quiet corner if you want to focus
10. Intentionally spend some amount of time without headphones on so others can approach you
11. Send "slack warnings" if you are going to come interrupt someone to reduce surprise

## Common Mistakes & Misconceptions

The following actions should be avoided in a workplace:

1.  Don’t “Reply All” to an email chain. Understand the differences—and repercussions—between “Reply” and “Reply All” to avoid humiliation.
2.  Don’t have a personal conversation at your desk. Find a conference room to discuss after-work issues that you must have with your best friend, sister, significant other, or landlord (or anyone who isn’t related to work, actually).
3.  Don’t bring your emotions into the office. Your desk neighbor doesn’t want to hear your sob story from the weekend, so leave that at the door.
4.  Don’t be afraid to ask questions, despite how silly you think they seem. This way, you will avoid erroneously completing an entire project only to realize you did it all wrong.
5.  Don’t gossip about your coworkers…or your boss. You’re not hurting anyone but yourself when you do. Better yet, don’t be so intolerable that people gossip about you.
