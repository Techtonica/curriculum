## Lesson

The workplace is the location at which an employee provides work for an employer. That seems like a simple enough explanation, but it can become a bit more complex, especially in today's knowledge economy.

**What an Employee Needs to Know**

Your employer gets to choose your workplace. Generally, as long as they follow health and safety regulations, your employer can make what might seem like unreasonable demands. Some office spaces are large, and each employee has his or her own private office. It's more likely, though, that you have a cubicle or even share a table with other coworkers. If you prefer to work alone, your employer can say, “no, this is your assigned space.”

**Some of the suggestions which can be implemented in order to ensure a healthy and positive work environment are:**

1. Respect headphones as an indicator of busyness
2. Find a quiet corner if you want to focus
3. Intentionally spend some amount of time without headphones on so others can approach you
4. Send "slack warnings" if you are going to come interrupt someone to reduce surprise

You can refer to this [link](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/workplace-etiquette/) under the section 'Workplace Etiquette: The Dos' to know more steps to be taken regarding the workspace.

It will take 10 minutes and is a good read to ensure a positive workspace.
