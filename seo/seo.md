### Motivation

Google is where ~80% of all user searches originate. If you want your users to find your website, using Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in your content helps your site stand out to Google's mysterious algorithms.
It is a great way to increase the quality of your web site by making it user- friendly, faster and easier to navigate.[(by reliablesoft.net)](https://www.reliablesoft.net/what-is-search-engine-optimization-and-why-is-it-important/)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

The overall goal is to make your site findable, but don't forget about:

- Positive user experience (site looks professional, easy to navigate, meets expectations)
- Sustainable/maintainable strategy (SEO shouldn't be so complicated you can't keep up)
- Ensuring you're targeting and securing the right users

### Guided Practice

- Find and review a screenshot or actual dashboard for Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Google My Business.
- Browse and identify a few real examples of SEO-friendly content at work-- from initial search to opening the page and examining its metadata. May be helpful to prepare some examples in advance, especially if Internet access is unreliable.  

### Independent Practice

Review/identify SEO-friendly principles in another example set of content you find yourself. Consider the page title, SEO title, meta description, content, how quickly it loads (try opening it on a mobile device, if possible). What might this site do differently to improve? Or what is it doing that's likely working well?

### Challenge

Review your own portfolio site, connect it to some of the tools learned in this lesson, and make more SEO-friendly updates to the content, metadata, tags, etc.

### Check for Understanding

Have apprentices present/summarize SEO at work (and potential suggestions for improvement) to a partner. Apprentices can use an example of their choice-- such as a random site from the Internet or their own portfolio site.
