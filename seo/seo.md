# SEO

### Projected Time

30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites

- [HTML](/html/html.md)
- [VS Code](/vs-code/vscode.md)

### Motivation

Google is where ~80% of all user searches originate. If you want your users to find your website, using Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in your content helps your site stand out to Google's mysterious algorithms.

### Objectives

**Apprentices will be able to:**

- Define SEO, its purpose, and how it works
- Learn a few tools (Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Google My Business) to measure and experiment with SEO and site performance
- Learn the basics of creating SEO-friendly content

### Specific Things To Teach

- What we know about Google search algorithms (what it prioritizes in ranking a site)
- Technical details to improve local search results (backlinks, reviews, city, etc)
- Generating SEO-friendly content (content length, titles, meta descriptions, alt tags, custom/secure URLs, etc) to optimize for search rankings
- SEO and analytical tools to analyze site performance-- for mobile-friendly use, understanding the keywords used to find your site, and speed suggestions for optimal user-friendliness

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

The overall goal is to make your site findable, but don't forget about:

- Positive user experience (site looks professional, easy to navigate, meets expectations)
- Sustainable/maintainable strategy (SEO shouldn't be so complicated you can't keep up)
- Ensuring you're targeting and securing the right users

### Guided Practice

- Find and review a screenshot or actual dashboard for Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Google My Business.
- Browse and identify a few real examples of SEO-friendly content at work-- from initial search to opening the page and examining its metadata. May be helpful to prepare some examples in advance, especially if Internet access is unreliable.  

### Independent Practice

Review/identify SEO-friendly principles in another example set of content you find yourself. Consider the page title, SEO title, meta description, content, how quickly it loads (try opening it on a mobile device, if possible). What might this site do differently to improve? Or what is it doing that's likely working well?

### Challenge

Review your own portfolio site, connect it to some of the tools learned in this lesson, and make more SEO-friendly updates to the content, metadata, tags, etc.

### Check for Understanding

Have apprentices present/summarize SEO at work (and potential suggestions for improvement) to a partner. Apprentices can use an example of their choice-- such as a random site from the Internet or their own portfolio site.
