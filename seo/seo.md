### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

The overall goal is to make your site findable, but don't forget about:

- Positive user experience (site looks professional, easy to navigate, meets expectations)
- Sustainable/maintainable strategy (SEO shouldn't be so complicated you can't keep up)
- Ensuring you're targeting and securing the right users

### Guided Practice

- Find and review a screenshot or actual dashboard for Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and Google My Business.
- Browse and identify a few real examples of SEO-friendly content at work-- from initial search to opening the page and examining its metadata. May be helpful to prepare some examples in advance, especially if Internet access is unreliable.  

### Independent Practice

Review/identify SEO-friendly principles in another example set of content you find yourself. Consider the page title, SEO title, meta description, content, how quickly it loads (try opening it on a mobile device, if possible). What might this site do differently to improve? Or what is it doing that's likely working well?

### Challenge

Review your own portfolio site, connect it to some of the tools learned in this lesson, and make more SEO-friendly updates to the content, metadata, tags, etc.
