### Motivation
Regardless of a person's experience level it's important to be
relatively comfortable answering the types of questions you can expect
in a technical interview. The more of your mental energy that is focused
on solving technical questions posed by an interviewer instead of
trying to recall a basic concept of programming, the more confident you
will feel and the more successful you'll be.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Solve problems using common data structures.
- Describe their thought process while solving a problem.
- Analyze their solution for performance improvements.
- Build a usable app that interacts with a public api.
- Demonstrate knowledge using a whiteboard.

### Specific Things To Teach
- Whiteboarding
- Pair programming
- Code challenges
- Fetching data remotely and rendering
- Form submission

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- Be careful to answer the question that's being asked.
- Avoid assuming the question is one you have already practiced.
- Don't rush.
- Make sure to come prepared with questions to ask as well. For example
find out as much as you can about what technologies and tools they use.

### Guided Practice
Walk through several example questions and demonstrate successful and
unsuccessful attempts to answer questions. Choose different types.
- Whiteboarding question:

- Predicting - Questions where a candidate is shown
example code and they determine the outcome of that code:

### Independent Practice
Look through the materials sections of this guide and try a variety of
different challenges. Do several questions for each website and then
move on to the next one. Get comfortable with questions that feel and
look unfamiliar.

### Challenge
Build a small React app that fetches some data from an API. Try finding
something at [Any API](https://any-api.com/?tag=open%20data) for example
to provide an API service to use.

When the participant is able to fetch data and render it in their own React
app have them manipulate the data in some way. For example make every
third word of a paragraph all caps.

### Check for Understanding

Participants give each other whiteboard examples to solve and pair program using example questions. In each
example one participant will be the interviewer and another will be interviewed. Time the questions to get a sense of how an interview will feel.
