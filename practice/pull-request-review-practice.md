# Pull Request Review Practice and Application Building

## Prerequisites

- **Time Management**: Revisit the "[Time Management](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VGlfYtWXQ8TEXsq4Bad0k2WZ-mK02hI3UwVXrfuUpPA/edit#slide=id.g23e19df823_0_0)" slide deck.
- **Full Stack Application Source Code**: Participants should have their completed full stack applications from Week 7 ready.
- **Basic Git and GitHub Knowledge**: Familiarity with creating branches, making commits, and submitting pull requests.

## Objectives

Participants will be able to:

- Understand and practice the pull request (PR) review process.
- Effectively create and review pull requests.
- Collaborate with peers or mentors to break down work, manage time, and share progress.

## Specific Things to Learn

- How to create a high-quality pull request with clear titles, descriptions, and visuals.
- How to review pull requests effectively and provide actionable feedback.
- Strategies for addressing and resolving feedback on a pull request.

## Motivation

This lesson integrates interactive PR review practice into Week 8's application-building project. By revisiting time management and collaboration strategies, participants will learn how to handle peer feedback while concurrently building a game application with an API. This exercise helps participants:

- Develop skills to review code written by others.
- Improve their ability to articulate coding logic and identify areas of improvement.
- Enhance collaboration and accountability within their trio or with a mentor.

## Challenge

Participants should aim to resolve all comments in their PR review while providing constructive feedback to their feedback partner's pull request.

## Real-World Application

The ability to read, understand, and critique others’ code is a critical skill for software development. This exercise mirrors professional workflows where collaboration and peer review ensure the quality and maintainability of software projects.

## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **Overlooking the PR structure:** Avoid unclear titles or missing descriptions in PRs.
- **Ignoring feedback:** Actively engage with feedback to show accountability.
- **Miscommunication in collaboration:** Ensure clarity when describing changes or feedback.

## Lesson Plan

### Activity 1: Pull Request Basics

**Task:** Each participant will create a pull request for a basic change in a shared repository.

1. **Instructions:**

   - Add your name to the [participants.md file](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/practice/participants.md) in the Techtonica curriculum repository.
   - Submit a pull request with:
     - **Title:** A concise, descriptive title.
     - **Description:** A clear explanation of the change.
     - **Visuals:** Screenshots with before-changes and after-changes labels in the description.

2. **Outcome:**
   - Participants practice creating detailed pull requests.

### Activity 2: Interactive PR Review Process

**Task:** Participants will engage in a two-way PR review process using their Week 7 full stack application code.

#### Repo Owner:

1. **Push a commit:** Remove all comments from your Week 7 application.
2. **Review:** Evaluate incoming changes from your feedback partner’s pull request, leaving comments as needed.

#### Collaborator:

1. **Add comments:** Create a branch and add comments explaining what each line of code does in the repo owner’s project.
2. **Submit a pull request:** Submit these changes to the repo owner for review.

### Activity 3: Addressing PR Feedback

**Task:** Pull request owners must address feedback using all of the following methods:

- **Acknowledged:** React to the feedback with an emoji to show it is accepted.
- **Replied:** Respond to comments by explaining your approach or adding items to a backlog for future review.
- **Resolved:** Make updates directly in the PR and link the new commit to the comment, marking the conversation as resolved.

## Questions to Consider

- How does the PR review process enhance code quality and collaboration?
- How can you break down work and share progress effectively with your trio or mentor?

## Supplemental Materials

- [GitHub Documentation: Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)

## Independent Practice

Participants will continue working on their Week 8 project (Game with API) while practicing the PR review process to balance individual and collaborative work effectively.
