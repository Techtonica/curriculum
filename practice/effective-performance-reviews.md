## Objectives

This activity aims to prepare participants for the performance review process (weeks 9-11) by providing clarity on giving constructive feedback and effectively receiving and processing feedback from peers and mentors.

## Pre-Requisites

- [Feedback Training Guide](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/career/feedback_training_guide.md)

## Participants Will Be Able To

- Distinguish between actionable and non-actionable feedback
- Craft specific, constructive feedback that promotes growth
- Respond professionally to both positive and constructive feedback
- Ask clarifying questions when feedback is vague or unclear
- Apply feedback effectively to their professional development
- Give feedback that respects others' identities and experiences

## Specific Things to Learn

- The structure and purpose of performance reviews
- Components of effective feedback (specific, actionable, balanced)
- Techniques for delivering constructive criticism respectfully
- Strategies for receiving feedback without defensiveness
- Methods for following up on feedback to demonstrate growth

## Motivation

Performance reviews are a critical professional skill that extends beyond this program. Learning to give thoughtful feedback helps others grow, while receiving feedback gracefully accelerates your own development. These skills directly translate to workplace success and career advancement.

## Challenge

Many people find performance reviews uncomfortable—both giving and receiving feedback can be emotionally challenging. Specific challenges include:

- Providing feedback that is honest yet respectful
- Receiving criticism without becoming defensive
- Determining which feedback requires action and which doesn't
- Giving feedback that is specific enough to be useful
- Balancing positive recognition with areas for improvement

## Real-World Application

- Regular performance reviews are standard in most professional environments
- The ability to give and receive feedback effectively is valued by employers
- These skills improve team dynamics and project outcomes
- Feedback skills enhance communication in all professional relationships
- Self-awareness from feedback processes accelerates career growth

## Common Mistakes & Misconceptions

A mistake is an incorrect action, behavior, or execution. A misconception is an incorrect belief, understanding, or mental model.

- **Mistake**: Giving vague feedback like "you need to participate more" without specific examples
- **Misconception**: All feedback requires immediate action or change
- **Mistake**: Focusing only on weaknesses without acknowledging strengths
- **Misconception**: Feedback is primarily about criticism rather than growth
- **Mistake**: Taking feedback personally rather than professionally
- **Misconception**: The goal of feedback is to be "nice" rather than helpful
- **Mistake**: Not considering the recipient's communication style when delivering feedback

## Lesson Plan & Activity

You will be provided example feedback given to person 🅰️ and person 🅱️. Over the course of the day, you will analyze the feedback in efforts to inform the way you give and receive your own feedback during the cohort performance review.

### During Stand Up (30 minutes)

1. **Staff Overview** (10 minutes)

   - Review cohort accomplishments to date
   - Explain performance review timeline and expectations
   - Share anonymized example feedback 🅰️ about participation and autonomy

2. **Group Discussion** (20 minutes)

   - Analyze the following feedback example:

     🅰️ This individual's engagement in team activities fluctuates, making it hard to gauge their full potential for independent work. On occasions when they're fully involved, their self-reliance shines through. Consistent participation would provide a clearer picture of their capabilities.

   - Discuss: Is this feedback actionable? How would you respond?
   - Share strategies for addressing inconsistent participation feedback

### After Stand Up (45 minutes)

1. **Cohort Buddy Activity** (45 minutes)

   - Review the following feedback example:

     🅱️ When confronted with obstacles, this person tends to dwell on identifying issues rather than brainstorming solutions. Adopting a more solution-centric approach could enhance their ability to handle frustrations and serve as an inspiration to their peers.

   - In pairs, discuss:
     - How would you clarify this feedback if you received it?
     - What specific actions could address this feedback?
     - How would you follow up to show improvement?
   - Practice giving each other a piece of constructive feedback using the learned framework

### Throughout the Day (60 minutes)

1. **Mentor Session** (60 minutes)

   - Review both feedback examples:

     \***\* Question: What is one thing this person could do to improve their recommendation score as a great coworker (please give clear and actionable feedback)?\*\***

     🅰️ I suggest they actively pursue more collaborative opportunities and voice their opinions more frequently during informal group discussions. Their insights are valuable, and increased engagement would benefit both their personal growth and team dynamics.

     🅱️ There have been occasions where they've inadvertently used incorrect pronouns for team members. I recommend they pay extra attention to learning and correctly using everyone's preferred pronouns, or respectfully asking for clarification when uncertain.

   - Discuss mentor's experiences with performance reviews
   - Practice crafting responses to challenging feedback
   - Role-play a feedback conversation (both giving and receiving)

### During Wrap Up (30 minutes)

1. **Reflection and Sharing** (20 minutes)

   - Participants share insights from mentor discussions
   - Discuss the following positive feedback examples:

     Question: What is one thing that this person has done well or shown great growth with during their time at Techtonica?

     🅰️ Although our direct collaboration has been limited, their self-assurance and distinctive project approach are notable. They maintain an excellent balance in meetings, contributing enthusiastically while allowing space for others. Their openness in asking questions and admitting knowledge gaps cultivates a supportive learning atmosphere for everyone.

     🅱️ Their vibrant energy, positive outlook, effective communication, and quick learning abilities are truly impressive. They exemplify an ideal colleague through their approachability, kindness, diligence, and intelligence.

   - Identify one feedback skill to focus on improving

2. **Action Planning** (10 minutes)

   - Analyze feedback:
     - What is the core message?
     - Is this feedback specific enough to act on?
     - What clarifying questions might I ask?
     - What specific actions could address this feedback?
     - How will I know if I've successfully addressed this feedback?
     - Is follow up needed?
   - Consider the following additional feedback:

     Question: Is there anything else that it could be helpful for this person to know?

     🅰️ Increasing their vocal contributions and initiating more interactions would be advantageous, as they demonstrate excellence when they do speak up and connect with others.

     🅱️ While your commitment to projects is admirable and the results are impressive, it's vital to prioritize self-care and maintain healthy boundaries. Ensure you're getting adequate rest and personal time to sustain your outstanding work and overall well-being.
