# JavaScript 2

### Projected Time
About 1 hour
- 20 minutes for the video walkthrough of the slides
- 30 minutes for Independent Practice

### Prerequisites
- "JavaScript 1" lesson

### Motivation
JavaScript is used on the frontend of almost every website. It's also a widely-used scripting language that be used on the backend as well. The JavaScript lessons set a solid foundation in JavaScript basics so we can use the language in more robust ways in later lessons.

### Objective
**Apprentices will be able to**
- Create arrays using the proper syntax
- Create nested arrays
- Index into arrays
- Change data inside an array using index reassignment
- Change data inside an array using `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()` and `.unshift()`
- Define a function using proper syntax
- Pass arguments into a function
- Understand the difference between global scope and local scope

- Please watch the video the first time without working along with the demonstration. Just absorb the concepts. Then, you can watch the demonstration a second time and code with the instructor if you like.

### Things to Remember

- **Use commas in your array to separate each data point.** You'll get a syntax error if you don't.

- **Parameters are placeholders (p and p!). Arguments are actual values (a and a!).** Parameters serve as placeholders in the function definition. Arguments are actual values you want the function to process once you call it.

### Demonstration

Instructor demonstrates in the video walkthrough how to work with arrays and functions in JavaScript.


### Independent Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pair partners.

1. In [REPL.it](https://www.repl.it), create a function called `printCuteAnimals` that expects an array to be passed in as an argument. You can name the function parameter whatever you like. When you pass the array to the function, it should contain strings, and the strings should be types of animals you think are cute.

Your function should:
1. First print the entire array and its length.
2. Print the array after you have called the `.pop()` method on it.
3. Concatenate another array of animal names onto the exisitng array. Feel free to look up how to do this using Google!
4. Print the array again and its new length.
5. Return the array.

### Challenge

Using MDN's JavaScript documentation, identify 1 - 3 array methods (look on the left column) that you can incorporate into your function, and see if you can.
