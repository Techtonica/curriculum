# Javascript 8 - Regular Expressions / RegEx

### Projected Time
About 4 hours
- 30 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 180 minutes for Independent Practice
- 30 minutes for checking understanding

### Prerequisites
- JS 1 lesson
- JS 2 lesson
- JS 3 lesson
- JS 4 lesson

### Motivation
- Regular Expressions allow you to search and modify strings using a special language. They are very powerful and can enable writing significantly less code.

### Objectives
**Apprentices will be able to:**
- Read and write RegEx in Javascript
- Use RegEx to test and replace strings
- Understand basic regular expression special characters: `.*+?\w\d`

### Specific Things To Teach
- JavaScript's RegExp syntax/structure
- Basic regular expression characters
- How RegExp modifiers work
- The 4 string methods and 2 RegExp methods that work with RegExps

### Supplemental Materials
- [Regular Interactive Visualizer and Tester](https://regexr.com/)
- [Regex Testing Tool](https://www.regextester.com/)
- [Javascript Regular Expressions (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

### Things to Remember
- There are two ways to use RegEx: 
	- RegEx as input to 4 String methods: `String.replace()`, `String.match()`, `String.search()`, `String.split()`
	- String as input to 2 RegEx methods: `RegExp.test()`, `RegExp.exec()`
- You can add modifiers to RegEx
- The pattern goes between the two forward slashes, and you can use back slashes to escape special characters
- There are a lot of complex RegEx patterns. We'll teach the basic ones, but there are many more you can learn as you go. 

### Demonstration
Instructor demonstrates in the video walk through how to work with Regular Expressions in JavaScript.

### Independent Practice
- Go through the tutorial at https://regexone.com. Do at least lessons 1-10. This isn't Javascript specific, but it will help you understand how to match text with regular expressions.
- Write a function that takes a word and returns true if the word ends with `tonica`
- Write a function expression that takes a string replaces all instances of `symantec` with `semantic`?
- Write a function that takes a string and deletes all words that end in `ing`?
- Write a function that takes a string and returns true if it is an email address? Compare your answer with your neighbor.
- Write a function that takes a string containing names separated by commas like `"Leah, Russell, Michelle"` and returns an array of names, `["Leah", "Russell", "Michelle"]`

### Challenge
- Write a regular expression that matches any participant name, but not any staff name
- What about a regular expression for all even-length strings?
- Do lessons 11+ on https://regexone.com

### Check for Understanding
- Make a cheat sheet to remind yourself about the different regular expression characters and how to use them.
