# JavaScript 5

### Projected Time
About 90 minutes
- 15 minutes for lesson
- 75 minutes for Independent Practice

### Prerequisites
- [Javascript 4 Lesson](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/javascript/javascript-4.md)

### Motivation
JavaScript is used on the frontend of almost every website. It's also a widely-used scripting language that be used on the backend as well. The JavaScript lessons set a solid foundation in JavaScript basics so we can use the language in more robust ways in later lessons.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Know when to use a switch statement instead of an if/else statement
- Write a switch statement using proper syntax

### Specific Things To Teach
- when to use a switch statement
- switch syntax

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **You need a `break` statement at the end of each `case`.**

- **There is no comparison operator in a switch statement, but there is one in the if/else statement**

### Independent Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pairs.

Refer back to the calculator activity from the JavaScript 1 lesson. Refactor your code to replace your if/else statement(s) with switch statement(s).

### Challenge
Refer back to the movie night activity from the JavaScript 3 lesson. Refactor your code to replace your if/else statement(s) with switch statement(s).
