### Motivation

Writing JavaScript in one file is a good place to start while you're learning, but real-world JavaScript applications are organized into multiple files so it will be useful for you to familiarize yourself with modular application structures.

Why write modular code? Here are some benefits:

- **Readability**: Smaller files with single responsibilities are easier and quicker to read.
- **Collaboration**: A team of developers working on a single file would encounter a lot of [git merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts). A modular file structure reduces the chance for conflicts and improves developer experience.
- **Quality**: One file with a single responsibility is easier to test than an entire application because it can be tested in isolation to create [unit tests](/testing-and-tdd/testing-and-tdd.md#unit-tests).
- **Velocity**: If a file is created in a modular way, it will be easier to reuse later, speeding up the development of new features later on.

### Lesson

The main way an application can be broken up into multiple files is by considering the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Historically when it comes to web development, this has been interpreted as separation of technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the past it was common to see a structure like this:

```
.
├── index.html
├── index.css
└── index.js
```

However, [React has led us to rethink this paradigm](https://youtu.be/x7cQ3mrcKaY) by enabling us to colocate JavaScript, HTML ([jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)), and CSS ([css-in-js](https://css-tricks.com/a-thorough-analysis-of-css-in-js/)) all in a single component file, and instead has divide the concerns using the [principle of single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle). A good React component encapsulates everything it needs to render itself, which does indeed require HTML and CSS along with JavaScript.

This leads to an application structure that looks more like:

```
.
├── Avatar.jsx
├── Comment.jsx
├── Input.jsx
└── Modal.jsx
```

You will see both of these structures in use in real-world applications, and you might even see them both used in one application.

### Guided Practice

Let's quickly go over what it looks like to create a modular structure. Let's say we have a file called `index.jsx`, and it contains this:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [userInput, setUserInput] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        onChange={(event) => setUserInput(event.target.value)}
        value={userInput}
        type="number"
      />
      <div>Your value plus one is {userInput + 1}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

root.render(<App />);
```

You might think about breaking this up into multiple files by considering the different things your application is doing. Right now, this file is doing three things:

- Rendering the application
- Collecting user input
- Performing a calculation

So given those three things, you could break your application up like this:

```
.
├── App.jsx
├── Input.jsx
└── operations.js
```

`operations.js` would only be concerned with manipulating data:

```js
export function addOne(n) {
  return n + 1;
}
```

`Input.jsx` would collect user input:

```jsx
import { addOne } from './operations';

const Input = () => {
  const [userInput, setUserInput] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        onChange={(event) => setUserInput(event.target.value)}
        value={userInput}
        type="number"
      />
      <div>Your value plus one is {addOne(userInput)}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Input;
```

`App.jsx` would only be concerned with rendering the application:

```jsx
import Input from './Input';
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Input />
  </div>
);

root.render(<App />);
```

### Independent Practice

Take some time to explore open-source libraries and see how they are structured.

- [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/packages/mui-base/src)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react/src)
- [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/lib/components/src)
- [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)
