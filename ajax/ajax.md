### Projected Time
About 4 hours

- Lesson: 50 mins
- Hands-on Explanation: 50 mins 
- Guided Practice: 1 hr
- Independent Practice: 1 hr
- Check for understanding: 20-30 mins

### Prerequisites
- [JavaScript Lessons](/javascript)
- [jQuery Lesson](/jquery/jquery)
- [API/JSON Lesson](/api/apis-and-json)

### Motivation
Front-end code of interactive websites often needs to talk to backend servers to get and present data that the user asks for. Usually, this is done using API calls. AJAX is a way to make asynchronous calls to the server using JavaScript.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**
- Make AJAX calls to an API to servers.

### Lesson
- Read through lesson slides [AJAX](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S3BjcLZNjex2_qiA9MdyJOjWZ_qmJ78STbUeDEyHH_8/edit#slide=id.p)

### What is AJAX ?
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a **technique** by which front-end get data from the backend by making *asynchronous* API calls.
Because AJAX is *asynchronous*, you must pass in a callback function to handle the received data. Making an AJAX request without any callback function will not have any effect on your application.

### Full Load Page V/s AJAX
> Lets say there is an input box and a button. Onclick of button the page shows some data say *hello world* send by the *server*. When the button is clicked -  
#### Full load Application Flow
1. The browser sends a request to a server designated by the URL. 
2. The server does some processing, probably queries a database, then responds to the browser by sending back HTML and JavaScript
3. The browser renders that HTML and JavaScript into a webpage.

#### AJAX Flow
1. The client sends a request to the server.
2. The server does some processing and returns the corresponding data (usually in JSON format).
3. When the request gets completed the callback function is executed in which data is received. That data is shown on frontend through JavaScript in any format you want.

| Difference Point        | Full Load Page          | AJAX  |
| ------------- |:-----------------:| :---------:|
| Client requests to server   | waits for response  | can perform other task simultaneously  |
| Server Response       | responds a corresponding HTML page  |  responds with data (preferably JSON ) |
| Render |  a complete new page is rendered   | only that part of page changes which has requested |
| Thread Blocked | true   | false |
| Data Received by | the browser in form of HTML   | JavaScript (callback or Promise) |

### What does AJAX do?
Let's say this website that the end user is visiting is an e-commerce site. The end user is browsing a list of products, sees a product they want to buy, and clicks the "Buy" button. This action (clicking the "Buy" button) triggers the request/response steps listed above, this time for the purpose of putting the product in the shopping cart.

Before AJAX, the request/response cycle could only happen with the web page *as a whole*. The end user, by clicking the "Buy" button, would cause the backend server to generate a completely new set of HTML and JavaScript, and the browser would reload and render it as an entirely new page.

AJAX, however, enabled the browser to make requests and only re-render *parts* of a webpage. This was beneficial performance-wise, because smaller strings of HTML, rather than all the HTML for the entire page, was all that was needed to be sent by the server and rendered by the browser. This also made the end user's browsing experience smoother: interactions with the webpage resulted in changes on screen without being interrupted by a reload.

### Remember
[Thread of Execution](/javascript/javascript-async-9)


### Hands-On Practice 
* HTML
	* Create a button on which when clicked an API is called and data is fetched.
```
<button class="btn" onclick="getData()"> Show Data </button>
```
* CSS
	* Add simple styles to the button.	
```
.btn{
	padding: 10px;

}
```
* JS
  * A function that fetch data from API and displays on the HTML page.
```
function getData() {
  console.log("Function getData is executed");
  fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1", {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log("data", data);
      let element = document.getElementById("data");
      element.textContent = data.title;
    });
}
```

### Guided Practice
- Work through [this AJAX tutorial on Codecademy.](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/requests-i/exercises/requests-intro-i)

### Independent Practice
- Look at this article on alternative ways to make asynchronous calls.  AJAX, Fetch, and Async/Await are just different syntaxes for making the same sort of call.  [Beginners Guide To Fetching Data With (AJAX, Fetch API & Async/Await)](https://dev.to/bjhaid_93/beginners-guide-to-fetching-data-with-ajax-fetch-api--asyncawait-3m1l)
- Read [this very short article on Axios](https://flaviocopes.com/axios/), which is an npm package that uses ajax under the hood. Developers like it because it is supported by all legacy and current browsers, and has methods that make some tasks like interpreting received data or setting request timeouts really simple.

### Points to Remember
- AJAX is not a programming language. It is a technique.
- It works *Asynchronously* to fetch data from API.
- Since it works *Asynchronously*, data is received in form of Promise or Callback function.

- Try the same exercises above using the [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) object instead of AJAX to better understand what the AJAX wrapper does

### Check for Understanding
Make the simplest project you can on Codepen.io.  The project must:
- make a successful ajax 'get' request to an external API
- Display all or part of that request on the webpage using jQuery
