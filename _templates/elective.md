_Template Intro_

**Elective Template**

Elective resources are content that is not part of the core in-person curriculum roadmap, but that is a valuable framework, tool, or technique to learn as a web application engineer.

It is shorter than a normal [topic outline](./topic-outline.md) and typically uses more external resources.

Copy this file as a starting point and create your new file in the `/electives` folder. Your elective should include the following sections:

# <TECHNOLOGY NAME>

## Motivation

Write one short paragraph or bulleted list than answers the following:

- Why is it worth spending extra time to learn this technology?
- How do it compare do similar material covered in the main curriculum. See the root [README](/README.md) for topics already covered
- What problem does it solve?
- Why would you recommend it?
- Do not go into implementation details, as you can link to docs that do that later

## Description

What is the technology? Instead of using the project's own description, how would you describe it to a junior engineer?

## How to Get Started

Link to a free hands-on tutorial on getting started with the app. [Example for React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from their official docs.

Please only include one tutorial here, one you gave gone through yourself and vetted for quality. If you have a few you like, choose the best one for a beginner audience. Any runner-ups can go in the "Further Reading" section below.

## Further Reading

- For a library/tool always include links to the official docs and
- link its GitHub page
- The next best thing to read after the above content
- A list of important links to blogs and docs about the tech
