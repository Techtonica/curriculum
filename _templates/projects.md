## Project Title  

### Languages
- Lang1
- Lang2

### Frameworks
- FW1
- FW2

### Primary Goals
1. Include the SWBAT/AWBAT in this section.
Each project's primary learning outcomes should directly reflect the SWBAT for each Topic that is covered with the project. For example - the second project for the apprentices is Server Side JavaScript. SSJS should include all objectives the Apprentices have practiced during the week of the project. SSJS for example, will include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node, and, Express.

### Overview
In this project, you will (what they will do) and practice (what they will practice) in order to (what they will learn).

### Context
- This is what you already know, and we are building on top of it
- This is why you are building this app.
- This is the value to your future self if you do this lab exercise

### Basic Requirements
1. Apprentices will obtain a code review by asking for a code review using the Techtoncia #tech-help Slack Channel.
2. Apprentices will submit project by Friday of the week that it is assigned.

## Setup Instructions (DO NOT DELETE - GOES IN EVERY PROJECT)
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [Shell Commands](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LuOLcpSAtNQlbULx9nWgXJNhgWQlfQ4nzLWQ0DuuPQk/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

Navigate to the `techtonica-labs` folder located in your Desktop.  
Create a new folder called `getting-started-with-node` within the `techtonica-labs` folder.  
Navigate to `getting-started-with-node`.  
Initialize `getting-started-with-node` as a git repository.  

If you have questions, do not disturb other pairs until you have spent 15-20 minutes troubleshooting within your own pair. Post a message on the #help channel in Slack if you and your pair partner are still stuck after 15-20 minutes. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O45nkq2bZX4ZDenmmA1lJ3iTvI80RXiPuOX2w__6Ykw/edit?usp=sharing) lesson.

### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the project to what was covered in the given weeks Topic Outlines.
- Ask questions that connect this project to prior Topic Outlines or Independent Practice.
- Also ask questions that require the student to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can you as an apprentice work on once you have fulfilled the basic requirements for this project? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for apprentices who are moving through the material faster than other apprentices. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this project. Apprentices should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next Topic Outline.
