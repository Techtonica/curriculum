- Lesson: 30min
- Guided Practice: 30min
- Independent Practice: 30min

### Prerequisites

Here are topics that should be understood before this topic. **Try to minimize these and even if the reader has learned a topic, don't assume they are an expert.** Briefly reminding them of concepts is helpful for learning.

- [Git version control](../git/git-version-control.md)

### Motivation

Why it is worth learning this topic

- Include links to future lessons/work this will help with - this will plant the seed later
- How does fit this tool fit into the ecosystem? (if applicable)
- If a fellow engineer asked about this tool/technique, what would your succinct answer be?
- If it's especially helpful for interviews, that's good motivation
- Try to use rationale that won't change. "X is popular" or "Big Company Y uses Framework Z" are likely to be stale quickly.

### Objectives

The important areas you should leave this lesson knowing.

[ ] How to do X
[ ] Difference between A and B
[ ] Be able to build Y

### Lesson

A high-level, skimmable introduction to the topic.

It can contain links to external materials but you should summarize here in your own words.

### Common Mistakes & Misconceptions

This section is optional, but if there are common misunderstandings, please enumerate them here. List things that people might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

- i.e. Array.splice and Array.slice are totally different
- `for (let x of obj)` loops and `for (let elem in obj)` loops are different
- `const` variables are not immutable; they just can't be reassigned

### Guided Practice

Have the participants work with you as you do something step-by-step. This should be inlined here as original content, not just linked to an external tutorials.

### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it's less guided, more independent.

### Challenge

Building on the independent practice, here are some challenging optional add-ons the reader can do.

### Supplemental Materials

Here you can link in external tutorials, official or unofficial documentation pages, blogs, videos, etc.
