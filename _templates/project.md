_Template Intro_

Here is an example of a well-defined project, [Eventonica Part 3 (jQuery)](../projects/eventonica/eventonica-part3-jquery-ui.md)

# Project Template

## Primary Goal

- To build **\_\_**
- Include why that's useful in the world of software projects

### Secondary Goals

- Practice skills in **\_\_**

## Helpful Resources

- Link back to curriculum lessons that may be useful
- Or external links that might have code examples relevant to this project

## Requirements

- Detailed requirements, logic, mini user-stories, etc.
- This part should specify **what**, not how

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Create X

- For earlier projects, you should include very step-by-step instructions with code snippets.
- For later projects, you can just include any important intro steps and some code examples of the first step(s).

## Challenges

- Always include at least 2 optional extensions for participants who are ahead
- They should be open-ended and force the participant to figure it out on their own

## Submission Requirements

_Template users note: these requirements should usually be identical_

Please submit using the normal pull request submission process. If you are not 100% done by the deadline, submit what you have and note in the PR description what remains to be done.

# Good luck!
