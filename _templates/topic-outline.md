# Example Topic Outline (Replace with Title)

### Projected Time

Example: 30-45 minutes

- Lesson: ? min
- Guided Practice: ?-? min
- Independent Practice: ? min
- Check for Understanding: ?-? min

### Prerequisites

Here are topics that should be understood before this topic:

- Example: [Git version control](../git/git-version-control.md)

### Motivation

Why it is worth learning this topic

- Older versions of section included companies using the tech - this is not helpful and tends to get laughably outdated
- Include links to future lessons/work this will help with - this will plant the seed later
- How does fit this tool fit into the ecosystem or full stack architecture? (if applicable)
- If a fellow engineer asked about this tool/technique, what would your succinct answer be?

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- leave this lesson knowing this
- and how to do this on their own
- Even more things
- Even more things

### Specific Things To Learn

- Focus on this specific talking point
- and this - This is a sub-thing about the thing
- Even more things about the things
- Even more things about the things

### Materials

- [Example video (10 min)](https://google.com) - Write a very short description of this resource.
- [Other example article(20 min read)](https://google.com) - Answer the 3 questions at the end.
  (Be sure to explain how to use these materials in directions in one of the sections below (ie: lesson, guided practice). If you are not assigning them somehow, they should be placed under Supplemental Materials at the bottom.)

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

- [Be sure to link the slideshow, video,](https://google.com)
- [or other materials you expect them to follow as part of the lesson.](https://google.com)

Build on the first information. Have participants make guesses, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:

- Things - This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things
- Even more things

### Common Mistakes & Misconceptions

List things that learners might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.

- Example
- Example

### Guided Practice

Have the participants work with you as you do something step-by-step. This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.

### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it's less guided, more independent.

### Challenge

Participants can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they've learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.

### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have participants summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps them self-assess their understanding. This exercise should help participants determine whether they've met the outline objectives, or if they need to review.ss
