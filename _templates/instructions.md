## Introduction

First thanks for volunteering to help Techtonica improve its curriculum!

## Style Guide

Your writing should our [style guide (NOT YET BUILT)](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/issues/596).

### Links
- Links to other parts of the curriculum should be relative links, not https://github.com links
- Do not repeat the link contents in the link text - come up with a clear title (don't use "Click here")

### Lesson Outline Style TL;DR
- Be concise
- Favor concrete examples over theory
- Favor inline code examples over links
- Visuals are sooooo helpful (find or create some)
- Make it skimmable; Participants will often not have time to read all the text fully
  - Use lots of headings
  - bold important text
  - Repeat important topics
  - Examples are worth a thousand words
  - Diagrams are worth ten thousand words

TBD: See [#569](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/issues/596).

## Lesson Length

Try to get someone to run through the lesson and exercises. Ideally, most lessons should be around 2 hours total (or less). Larger lessons should be split into parts.

## Links vs. Original Content

Typically, tutorials already exist for most of our lessons. Your job as a contributor is to provide the *context and glue* that turns a list of external links into a cohesive lesson.

## Outline vs. Slides vs. Slide Video

To support different learning styles, we like to offer the content in these three formats. However, if due to time constraints you can only work on one, Slides may be the most effective. Please note that typically the slides will be consumed alone, not actually presented by anyone, but they force a concise length and invite visuals.

**When in doubt, add slides.**

## Okay I am ready to get started
