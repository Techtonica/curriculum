## Lesson

### What is a personal brand?

Your personal brand is how you present yourself professionally to the world. It's the combination of your:

- Skills and expertise
- Communication style
- Values and interests
- Visual identity (profile photos, design choices)
- Content you create and share
- How you engage with others online
- Most new developers feel they need to be an expert at something before they can share on a topic. The irony is, there are not lots of free beginner content out there for new developer geared towards new developers and the same new developers are in the best position to teach each other today. No matter how new you are, there is someone who knows less than you and you are in the best position to teach them.
- Thinking your brand needs to be perfect from day one. It's an evolution; start small and iterate.
- Underestimating the power of consistency. Sporadic efforts have less impact than regular, even if small, contributions and engagements.

## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I need to be on every platform"** - Focus on quality engagement on 1-2 platforms rather than spreading yourself thin
- **"I don't have anything valuable to share"** - Even beginners have unique perspectives and learning journeys worth sharing
- **"I need thousands of followers to have a successful brand"** - Quality connections and engagement matter more than follower count
- **"I can't show my personality in a professional context"** - Authenticity helps you stand out; your unique perspective is valuable
- **"Once something is online, it's there forever"** - While true to some extent, you can actively shape your digital presence over time

## Independent Practice

1. Audit your current online presence and clean up any unprofessional content
2. Update your profiles on GitHub and one social platform of your choice
3. Create or update your personal website/portfolio
4. Draft a content calendar with 5-10 post ideas
5. Find and join 3 communities related to your tech interests
6. Commit to a realistic engagement schedule (e.g., posting once a week, engaging daily)
