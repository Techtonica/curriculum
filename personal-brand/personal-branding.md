How to win friends and stand out from the crowd
Build on the first information. Have participants guess things, do an activity, etc.

  - Join a community
- Make Friends
  - Get involved on Twitter and GitHub

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- Most new developers feel they need to be an expert at something before they can share on a topic. The irony is, there are not lots of free beginner content out there for new developer geared towards new developers and the same new developers are in the best position to teach each other today. No matter how new you are, there is someone who knows less than you and you are in the best position to teach them.

### Guided Practice

Follow [this tutorial](https://blog.markgrowth.com/how-to-start-a-beautiful-personal-blog-using-medium-ca6d89b7e46) to create your own blog on Medium!

### Independent Practice

Take some time this week to write a blog post on something you learned this week. Before posting to the world, have a fellow classmate review it to see if the information is useful. A typical suggestion is to blog for yourself 3-6 months ago.

Ship it and continue this process at least once a week. Remember to keep the blog post short at first to prevent writers block and anxiety about posting.

Promoting your blog is at least as important as writing it!
