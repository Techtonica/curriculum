### What is Personal Branding?

Your personal brand is how you present yourself professionally to the world. It's the combination of your:

- Skills and expertise
- Communication style
- Values and interests
- Visual identity (profile photos, design choices)
- Content you create and share
- How you engage with others online

### Why is Personal Branding Important?

You know your work, your accomplishments and your experiences best. You should be the one to bundle these up and shape the way you are presented to others.

- Make it as easy as possible for people (especially recruiters & hiring managers) to quickly understand your expertise and how you can add value to their company
- Your online presence should appear cohesive rather than unorganized and disjoint

### What is a personal brand?

Your personal brand is how you present yourself professionally to the world. It's the combination of your:

- Skills and expertise
- Communication style
- Values and interests
- Visual identity (profile photos, design choices)
- Content you create and share
- How you engage with others online
- Most new developers feel they need to be an expert at something before they can share on a topic. The irony is, there are not lots of free beginner content out there for new developer geared towards new developers and the same new developers are in the best position to teach each other today. No matter how new you are, there is someone who knows less than you and you are in the best position to teach them.
- Thinking your brand needs to be perfect from day one. It's an evolution; start small and iterate.
- Underestimating the power of consistency. Sporadic efforts have less impact than regular, even if small, contributions and engagements.

### Audit Your Current Online Presence

#### What comes up when you google yourself?

This is what others will see when they search for you!

- Is it good? Bad? Someone else with your name?
- Improve these results by getting more web pages online with your name on them
- Open (valid) social media accounts, create a blog, post to Medium

#### What do you "spike" at?

"Spike" means you're really good at something.

- Ideally, you like doing it, too
- Write a list of things you "spike" at
- Keep these things in mind as you start to consider how best to bundle your strengths and experience to craft your professional story

### Building Your Brand Elements

#### Your Photo

- Should be a headshot that clearly shows your face (optional: partial upper body)
- Avoid sunglasses, hats, heavy makeup, distracting backgrounds
- Smile!

#### Your Username

Many people incorporate all or part of their first and/or last name (recommended):

- Examples: "tanesha jones", "tanesha_codes", "tjones"

Something memorable that is also professional:

- Examples: "aeiou", "code_poet"

**Don't use** words that are unnecessarily personal, political, gendered, inappropriate or offensive.

#### Your Contact Info

- Your email should be the same username from your other accounts
- Otherwise, use some form of your first and last name
- Many people in tech communicate via Twitter. List your twitter handle, too
- **Never** list your phone number anywhere except on your resume
- **Never** give out your full address. "San Francisco" or "Silicon Valley" or "SF Bay Area" on your resume is fine

#### Your Business Cards

- Don't design them yourself
- There are thousands of beautiful business card designs on places like Moo and Vistaprint
- Once you're hired, your company will give you some with their logo and brand design
- Include your name, contact info and your role
- **Do not** include your photo (this is common practice only in sales and real estate)

### Best Practices for Consistent Branding

Across all platforms, use the same:

- Username
- Photo of yourself
- Contact info

**Make it easy for people to find you, recognize you, and learn more about you!**

- Carry business cards with you everywhere and give them away as often as you can
- Even if you aren't sure how that person can help you, or how you can help them. You never know.

### Developing Your Elevator Pitch

- Describe what you do in 20 seconds or less
- Project confidence by having a ready answer when people ask you, "So what do you do?"
- It might take you an hour to prepare for saying your elevator pitch with confidence!
- Brainstorm what you want to say, practice it, get feedback, refine your pitch

#### Example Pitch

"I'm Erin Allard and I'm a Software Engineering Instructor at Techtonica, a free tech training program for low-income women and non-binary adults, predominantly focused on people of color and those from other underrepresented groups. I'm passionate about teaching technical skills to people from underrepresented groups so they can be competitive in the Bay Area's job market."

### Writing Your Professional Bio

Your bio is an extended, written version of an elevator pitch.

- **Short**: Twitter & GitHub
- **Medium**: LinkedIn & speaking engagements
- **Long**: blog / portfolio

#### Short Bio

For Twitter & GitHub:

"Front-End Engineer at Lyft. Loves JS & pie."

#### Medium Length Bio

For LinkedIn & speaking engagements:

"Maria is a front-end engineer on the web development team at Lyft, passionate about creating simple, pleasing user experiences. Prior to graduating from Techtonica's tech training program, she studied art & design at SFSU. Maria loves coding in JavaScript and in her spare time likes to attend Girl Geek Dinners and go hiking."

#### Long Bio

For your blog / portfolio:

- Start with what you are currently doing or where you are currently working. Say what you love about it
- Describe what led you to where you are, and what schools (if any) you attended and what you studied there
- Move into professional topics you enjoy, then into a couple personal hobbies you have

#### GitHub

- **Essential for showcasing your coding work**

> _"Technical Leader [Noelle Russell](https://noellerussell.ai/) recommends trying to leave 5 good comments that truly engage with somebody else's content every (working) day, and I've really loved that approach for strengthening my network and helping to find people with similar interests. Knowing you're going to comment on at least 5 (or 4, 3, 2...) more things changes how I read posts!" — @MaggieFero_

### Content Ideas for Tech Professionals

### Creating a Personal Website or Blog

A personal website serves as the hub of your online presence that you fully control.

## Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I need to be on every platform"** - Focus on quality engagement on 1-2 platforms rather than spreading yourself thin
- **"I don't have anything valuable to share"** - Even beginners have unique perspectives and learning journeys worth sharing
- **"I need thousands of followers to have a successful brand"** - Quality connections and engagement matter more than follower count
- **"I can't show my personality in a professional context"** - Authenticity helps you stand out; your unique perspective is valuable
- **"Once something is online, it's there forever"** - While true to some extent, you can actively shape your digital presence over time

## Independent Practice

1. Google yourself - What comes up? Make notes on what you'd like to improve
2. Write your elevator pitch - Practice it with a partner and get feedback
3. Create your bio in 3 different lengths (short, medium, long)
4. Audit your current online presence and clean up any unprofessional content
5. Update your profiles on GitHub and one social platform of your choice
6. Create or update your personal website/portfolio
7. Draft a content calendar with 5-10 post ideas
8. Find and join 3 communities related to your tech interests
9. Commit to a realistic engagement schedule (e.g., posting once a week, engaging daily)
