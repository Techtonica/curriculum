# jQuery

Originally part of the Techtonica curriculum, our jQuery lesson was retired in 2020. Although still popular in legacy projects, jQuery is unnecessary with modern browsers since they all provide standardized DOM manipulation functions.

- If you're looking to learn how to manipulate the DOM without a framework, see [JavaScript DOM Methods](./js-dom-methods.md)
- If you're looking to make web applications, see [React Lessons](../react-js)
