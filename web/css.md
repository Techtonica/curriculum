### ProTip

Create a bookmark folder on your bookmarks bar called CSS and save the CSS articles from the curriculum in one space so you can review a list of what you've learned when building projects.

### Prerequisites

[HTML lesson](./html.md)

### Motivation

- Cascading style sheets(CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language like HTML. (Reference from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
- CSS enables the separation of presentation and content and this separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
- It can completely control how your web pages look without changing your HTML. It's an important language for front-end and full-stack web developers to know because today it is used in all web pages. (Referenced from [skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/2017/02/27/front-end-back-end-full-stack/) & [quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-important-concepts-in-CSS))

  **Which companies use CSS?** Everyone. Some companies with very beautiful sites are [Uber](https://www.uber.com) and [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/).

#### Looking at an example website

- Have you ever noticed that some websites are much more appealing than others?
- Go to [wildrenfrew.com](https://wildrenfrew.com/) and see how unique this website is. Some sections in this site are marvelous.
- The website is a complete package of correct font, color, images, and video that make it engaging.

## Lesson

1. Work through all the free lessons in order on the [Codecademy: Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/) syllabus (~ 4 hours). If it says "This lesson only comes with a Pro paid plan", you do not need to do it. Taking breaks in between each is recommended! They should each take around 30 minutes. If you are stuck on a certain step, reach out to your peers. This shouldn't happen often, though - it's very straightforward.

- [CSS Setup and Syntax](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/learn-css-setup-and-syntax/)
- [CSS Selectors](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/learn-css-selectors/)
- [Visual Rules](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-visual-rules/)
- [The Box Model](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/box-model-intro/)
- [Changing the Box Model](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/box-model-new/)
- [Display and Positioning](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-display-positioning/)
- [Color](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/color/resume)
- [Typography](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-typography/)

2. This is a good time for a longer break. Take one!

3. Read through Part 1 (30 min) and Part 2 (15 min) slides or watch the corresponding videos. They review what you covered in Codecademy.

### Things to Remember

- **You need some HTML code before you can add styling with CSS.**

- **HTML and CSS are two different languages.** Though commonly referred to together as "HTML/CSS", these are two distinct languages that do completely different things. They work really well together.

- **There are specificity rules in CSS.** You need to understand these rules so you can work within them to produce the styling you want.

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- A very common mistake made by intermediate developers is, "If I can make things look how I want, then it doesn't matter if something is actually a header, button, or label. I can just make a bunch of divs that look like headers, buttons, and labels." _Good semantic elements and sections have more built-in functionality than just changing visual styles._
  - A search engine uses the headers and sub-headers on a page for search terms and potential relevance. This is also known as SEO: Search Engine Optimization.
  - Those who use a keyboard instead of a mouse, or who use screen readers to navigate a page, actually receive extra information for their situation.
  - For example, a screenreader user can quickly jump from header to header to find what they need without having to listen to the entire page content or be reminded that they are still inside the same choice set in a [select element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select), how many choices there are, and which one is selected.
  - (Note: no need to read any links in this section thoroughly, they're just for reference.)
  - Also note that there are [typical patterns](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/#testing) many users are used to, and changing them will likely frustrate a user, causing them to give up on using your app.
  - This is not what we are learning today, but keep this in mind as you continue to learn more HTML. Accessibility and SEO will be covered in future outlines.

### Independent Practice

Change and remove style and link tags from [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/) and watch the website design change accordingly. Spend 5 minutes for each site.
