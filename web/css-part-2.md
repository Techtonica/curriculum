## Lesson

CSS concepts are not hard; it's using them all together effectively and neatly on a large scale that challenges people.  Experience is key, so let's get you some.

### Guided Practice
1. Spend 30 minutes playing [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/). You play by selecting certain HTML-like dishes and foods using CSS Selectors.
1. Spend 30 minutes playing [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).  This one is cute - you arrange frog on lily pads using flexbox.
1. During Flexbox Froggy or after, take 5 minutes to look at this [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/).  There are more good ones out there if you care to search.
1. Although CSS issues tend to be relatively easy to Google, https://css-tricks.com/ has one of the best collections of **CSS Guides**.  Take 15 minutes total to look at some of the most popular articles. You don't need to read them throughly, but instead get a feel for some of the common problems you'll be solving.

### Independent Practice

No pairs will be assigned for this project, but you should rely on your classmates for help once you've spent 20 minutes working independently through something you're stuck on.

The activity for the HTML, CSS, and JS DOM lessons is a project that allows you to combine your new skills in each of these areas.

Check for [Inline CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/html-inline-styles) contents while removing _style_ tag from the webpage.

Tutorials for changing and removing style tags are provided in the [CSS slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p-IXWxo0NEbZbHQ_Mdoo-A9dlFXqfSPOfW6navfyeTI/edit?usp=sharing)
