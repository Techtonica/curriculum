### Independent Practice

No pairs will be assigned for this project, but you should rely on your classmates for help once you've spent 20 minutes working independently through something you're stuck on.

The activity for the HTML, CSS, and JS Dom lessons is a project that allows you to combine your new skills in each of these areas.
