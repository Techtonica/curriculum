You are not expected to have this all memorized at the end of the lesson. Right now just get used to looking at CSS and try to see how the CSS relates to the HTML.

### Guided Practice

1. Spend 30 minutes playing [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/). You play by selecting certain HTML-like dishes and foods using CSS Selectors.
1. Spend 30 minutes playing [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). This one is cute - you arrange frog on lily pads using flexbox.
1. During Flexbox Froggy or after, take 5 minutes to look at this [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/). There are more good ones out there if you care to search.
1. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) has great detailed documentation on single CSS concept. Spend 5 minutes scanning these examples:
