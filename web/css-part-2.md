### Projected Time

About 5 hours

### Prerequisites

- [HTML lesson](/web/html.md)
-

### Motivation

- Cascading style sheets(CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language like HTML. (reference from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) & [town open-data portal](https://manualzz.com/doc/6479032/town-open-data-portal---dip%C3%B2sit-digital-de-la-ub))
- CSS enables the separation of presentation and content and this separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility, reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.([reference from Alan Dotchin academy](http://alandotchinacademy.com/content/technologies/css/index.html))
- It can completely control how your web pages look without changing your HTML. It's an important language for front-end and full-stack web developers to know because today it is used in all webpages.(reference from [skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/2017/02/27/front-end-back-end-full-stack/) & [quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-important-concepts-in-CSS))

### Lesson



### Things to Remember

- **You need some HTML code before you can add styling with CSS.**

- **HTML and CSS are two different languages.** Though commonly referred to together as "HTML/CSS", these are two distinct languages that do completely different things. They work really well together.

- **There are specificity rules in CSS.** You need to understand these rules so you can work within them to produce the styling you want.

### Independent Practice

No pairs will be assigned for this project, but you should rely on your classmates for help once you've spent 20 minutes working independently through something you're stuck on.

The activity for the HTML, CSS, and JS Dom lessons is a project that allows you to combine your new skills in each of these areas.

Check for [Inline CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/html-inline-styles) contents while removing _style_ tag from the webpage.

Tutorials for changing and removing style tags are provided in the [CSS slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p-IXWxo0NEbZbHQ_Mdoo-A9dlFXqfSPOfW6navfyeTI/edit?usp=sharing)
