### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step.  This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it's less guided, more independent.

### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they've learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.


### Check for Understanding

Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps them self-assess their understanding. This exercise should help apprentices determine whether they've met the outline objectives, or if they need to review.
