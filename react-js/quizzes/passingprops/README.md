Weekly Quiz - Understanding Passing Props.

Congratulations! You are working on your first ticket. Your task here is to document the code needed for onboarding the next SWE. The code is working correctly, so you don't need to fix anything, but your manager wants you to:

1. Write a comment in the code sending props from the form component to its parent component. Your comment should explain why the process is important, and please add a "Don't delete" note.

2. Write a comment in the code sending props from the parent component to the child component called message.jsx. You should explain in your comment why the process is important, and please add a note for not deleting it.

3. Inside the app.jsx component, include a comment that documents how the app works and how the data moves from one component to another.

4. Clone the project and update the README in your local. Please don't work in this repo since you don't have permission to push here.
