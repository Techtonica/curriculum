### Guided Practice:

**Cheat Sheet App:**

There's an optional app that shows you a Keyboard Shortcut cheat sheet on a mac whenever you hold down the command key in most applications. Note this will help with your command line app, but not the commands themselves. This app gets great reviews on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cheatsheet-2).

1. Download Cheat Sheet for Mac [here](https://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet/).
2. Install it, drag it into your applications, open it.
3. Change the settings it recommends in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility.
4. Navigate to different applications and try holding down the command key for 2 seconds to see if it works!

### Independent Practice:

- Apprentices are encouraged to practice the Keyboard Shortcut Practice App 30 minutes per week during their first month.

  1. Turn it off.
  2. Hold the 'mouse button' and while holding the button, turn it on.
  3. Keep holding the buton till the green light starts blinking repeatedly (this puts it in the discovery mode).
  4. Pair your Mac with the mouse through System Preferences > Bluetooth **or** System Preferences > Mouse.
  5. Rename your mouse to identify it easily (and not steal someone else's mouse).
