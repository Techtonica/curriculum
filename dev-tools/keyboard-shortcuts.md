Note: this will help with your command line app, but not the commands themselves. This app gets great reviews on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cheatsheet-2).

1. Download Cheat Sheet for Mac [here](https://macmost.com/printable-mac-how-to-cheat-sheet.html).
2. Install it, drag it into your applications, and open it.
3. Change the settings it recommends in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility.
4. Navigate to different applications and try holding down the command key for 2 seconds to see if it works!

### Independent Practice:

- Participants are encouraged to practice the Keyboard Shortcut Practice App 30 minutes per week during their first month.

**General Mac Tips:**

- **Two Finger Scrolling** - Slide two fingers up or down the trackpad to scroll.

- **Pairing a Magic Mouse** - To pair the magic mouse with your Mac:

  1. Turn it off.
  2. While holding down the 'mouse button', turn it on.
  3. Keep holding the button till the green light starts blinking repeatedly (this puts it in the discovery mode).
  4. Pair your Mac with the mouse through System Preferences > Bluetooth **or** System Preferences > Mouse.
  5. Rename your mouse to identify it easily (and not steal someone else's mouse).
