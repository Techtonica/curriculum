# VS Code - Setup and Local Development

### Projected Time

About 1 hour

- 7 minutes for video
- 20 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 15 minutes for Independent Practice
- 10 minutes for Check for Understanding

### Prerequisites

- [Command Line Interface lesson](/command-line/command-line-interface.md)

### Motivation

Most software is written using text editors. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a very popular open-source text editor developed and maintained by Microsoft. Having a good understanding of how to use VS Code will enable you to code and use other text editors with ease. Many developers prefer using VS Code for development because of its flexiblity and user interface. It provides lots of tools to make tasks easier.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Download and install VS Code
- Create a Terminal shortcut to open files in VS Code
- Change the UI theme of their VS Code application
- Use several keyboard shortcuts for more efficient coding while using VS Code
- Open and execute commands on the VS Code Integrated Terminal
- Open a file quickly using VS Code
- Run a global or local search
- Add a VS Code Extension

### Specific Things to Learn

- VS Code-specific keyboard shortcuts: [Personal Key Bindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
- VS Code Extension Marketplace: [Extension Manual](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)

### VSCode Tips

- **Reference**: [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5755942/how-do-you-auto-format-code-in-visual-studio/5755979)

* **Auto Indent** - VS Code package to format your JavaScript / TypeScript / CSS using [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). Or Select the text you want to automatically indent. Click Format Selection in Edit, Advanced, or press **CTRL+K, CTRL+F**.

* **Indent multiple lines** - Just highlight the lines you want, then press tab to indent the entire code block, or **shift+tab** to un-indent the entire code block.

* **Code Folding** - Folds the innermost uncollapsed region at the cursor.<br>
  **"Ctrl + Shift + ["** on Windows and Linux.<br>
  **"⌥ + ⌘ + ["** on macOS.
* **Autosave** - The easiest way to turn on **Auto Save** is with the menu **File > Auto Save** toggle that turns on and off save after a delay.

* **Key-Value** - An item of data that is identified by an arbitrary name. The key is the name, and the value is the content. For example, the key might be CITY, and the value might be CHICAGO. Key-value pairs are frequently used in lookup tables, hash tables and configuration files.<br>
  **Key-Value example:**<br>
  {<br>
  "firstname": "Chris",<br>
  "lastname": "Evans",<br>
  "city": "New York"<br>
  }

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I'll just use MS Word or Google Docs to write my code."** The only industry-acceptable programs for writing code are text editors that were created specifically for this purpose. MS Word and Google Docs are for creating personal and business documents, not for writing code.

- **"VS Code has a lot of bells and whistles, how will I ever pick them all up?"** VS Code gives you, the developer, a lot of control over your space. Some keyboard shortcuts will become second nature, while some things like setting your themes will only happen once in while -- with practice (and reference materials) everything will become second nature.

### Demonstration

Instructor demonstrates in the slide walkthrough how to change the color theme and use various keyboard shortcuts.

### Independent Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pairs.

1. Follow the instructions in the slides for downloading and installing VS Code if it is not already downloaded to your machine.

1. Using [VS Code's Getting Started manual](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) or other online resources, discover how to:

- Find and replace multiple occurrences of one word in the same file
- Click on multiple characters in one file at the same time
- Comment and uncomment text
- Indent and dedent lines of text
- Move one line up or down
- Open a side by side of a file
- Add a javascript extension to VS Code

As you learn how to do these tasks, make a cheat sheet (on
paper or in a note on your desktop) to remind you what the shortcuts are.

3. Add the shortcuts for the following tasks to your cheat sheet:

- Open VS Code
- Open a specific folder in VS Code
- Open a specific file in VS Code
- Open integrated terminal

### Challenge

- Add a personalized keyboard shortcut using VS Code's [Key Bindings manual](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).
- Make a commit through VS Code's version control tool [Version Control through VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)

Briefly summarize your findings so you can share with the class.

### Check for Understanding

Form small groups and discuss:

- How do you open a specific file or folder in VS Code?
- What is the keyboard shortcut to open the VS Code Integrated Terminal?
- What is the keyboard shortcut to comment and uncomment code?
- Imagine you wanted to change all of the occurrences of the word `dog` in a file to the word `cat`. What might be a useful keyboard shortcut?
- What are VS Code extensions? How do you add an extension? What are some extensions that might be useful to have?

### TABS vs SPACES

The age-old tabs vs spaces argument is a very heated and hilarious one. Some developers argue that tabs are better for code indentation while others argue that spaces are better. Both arguments are valid with the following points:

- Why would you want to press the SPACE BAR key X times when you can press the TAB key once? The tab key saves you more time in indentation thereby making you more efficient and it takes less space on the disk.
- Different machines and environments display the TAB character differently which means your code will look different to different people. The SPACE character does not have this problem, it will look the same for every single machine but will take up more memory for the source code. Developers indent pretty often when developing so the memory difference can easily add up.
  Both sides have a logical reason. The most important thing is that you pick a side and you and your team use it consistently across the project. Check out these resources below to understand my points better.

By default, VS Code attempts to guess your indentation options depending on the file you open. Indentation guessing can be turned off via: `"editor.detectIndentation": false`.

**Instructions to set up VS Code to use "spaces for tabs, 2 spaces per tabs" as your default for new files:**

**_For Windows Users_**

- Go to _File - Preferences - User settings_
- Then set the number of spaces a tab is equal to via: `"editor.tabSize": 2`. This setting is overriden based on file content when `"editor.detectIndentation": true`.
- Enable spaces to be inserted when pressing tab via: `"editor.insertSpaces": true`. This setting is overriden based on file content when `"editor.detectIndentation": true`.

**_For Mac Users_**

- Go to _Code - Preferences - Settings_
- Then set the number of spaces a tab is equal to via: `"editor.tabSize": 2`. This setting is overriden based on file content when `"editor.detectIndentation": true`.
- Enable spaces to be inserted when pressing tab via: `"editor.insertSpaces": true`. This setting is overriden based on file content when `"editor.detectIndentation": true`.

Visual Studio Code now includes an auto-indentation feature — which, as the name suggests, will automatically indent your code on the editor.The auto-indentation feature will automatically indent your code whenever you move a line around or a set of lines around. It will also automatically indent your code when you copy-paste something which will be really useful especially for those who use StackOverflow quite a lot. Auto-indentation on Visual Studio Code is currently disabled by default, and users can add the `editor.autoIndent` setting to the editor in order to enable it.
