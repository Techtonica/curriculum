# Best Practices in Client-side Development

### Projected Time

About 20-30 minutes

- Lesson: 20 min

### Prerequisites

[HTML](/web/html.md) and [CSS](/web/css.md)

### Motivation

- During development, we always focus on writing runnable code to complete our goal but, we ignore the best practices to make our code more readable & manageable.
- New contributors and repository/project maintainers can coordinate easily if they use common coding practices.
- Best practices are used to improve the quality of the software product.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**

- Understand the importance of dummy content during development.

### Specific Things to Learn

- Importance of Lorem ipsum text and images

### Lesson

- [About dummy text Lorem ipsum (10 min)](https://www.blindtextgenerator.com/about-lorem-ipsum) - Lorem Ipsum refers to text that developer/designer use as replacement text when the real text is not available. The purpose of Lorem Ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. Similar there is Lorem Picsum which refers to images that developer/designer use as filler images when the real images are not available.
- Lorem Ipsum/Picsum is filler text used before exact content is ready. It allows you to visualize the font-family and font colors until the real text is swapped in.
