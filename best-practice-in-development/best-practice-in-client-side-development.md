# Best Practices in Client-side Development

### Projected Time
About 20-30 minutes
- Lesson: 20 min

### Prerequisites
[HTML](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/html/html.md) and [CSS](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/css/css.md)

### Motivation
- During development, we always focus on writing runnable code but we mostly ignore some of the best practices that must be followed during development which makes our code more readable & manageable when we are working in a team of developers.
- The developer of new code and maintainer of existing code can communicate and coordinate easily if they adopt best practices.
- Best practices are used to improve the quality of the software product.

### Objectives
**Participants will be able to:**
- Understand the importance of dummy content during development.

### Specific Things To Teach
- Importance of Lorem ipsum text and images

### Lesson

- [About dummy text Lorem ipsum (10 min)](https://www.blindtextgenerator.com/about-lorem-ipsum) - Lorem Ipsum refers to text that developer and designer use as replacement text when the real text is not available. The purpose of Lorem Ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. Similar there is Lorem Picsum which refers to images that developer/designer use as filler images when the real images are not available.
