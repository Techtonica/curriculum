### React Counter App

You will create a counter app using React. The app should use `useState()` to update the counter and `onClick()` in each button to handle the logic for incrementing and decrementing. If you need help, you can watch [Learn useState in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6P86uwfdR0) - React Hooks Explained.
