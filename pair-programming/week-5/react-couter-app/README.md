### React Counter App

Create a counter app using React on any of the following platforms:

- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)
- Your **techtonica-assignment** folder in GitHub
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

Once completed, attach the link in the "finished work" column.

Use **useState()** to update the counter button and **onClick()** for handling the increment and decrement logic on each button. If you need guidance, check out [Learn useState In 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6P86uwfdR0) - React Hooks Explained.
