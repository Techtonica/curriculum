# Expressjs Project

### SetUp

You need to use express to do this exercise.
So, please do this locally and add it to your **Assignments** folder on Github and submit it with a PR

### Task

1. Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:

`index.html`
`about.html`

Create your "node.js" server file `index.js` and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.

`localhost:8080` should take users to index.html

`localhost:8080/about` should take users to about.html

Keep in mind that the content of these pages isn’t really all that important. So there’s no need to spend a lot of time filling them up or trying to make them look pretty.

**Note**:

- I have not added the package.json in this repo. Intialize the project with `npm init` and install `express` package
