## Create a responsive form using HTML and CSS.

1. Start by defining the HTML structure (using tags such as `form`, `label`, `input`) for the form elements

2. Style the form using CSS (including setting margins, padding, colors, fonts, and other visual properties)

3. Afterward, you can utilize media queries to adjust the layout and appearance of the form based on the viewport size. Media queries allow you to apply different styles depending on the characteristics of the device, such as its width.
