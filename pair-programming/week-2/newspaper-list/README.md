### Newspaper list

Here is the HTML code of a web page.

```html
<h3>Some newspapers</h3>
<div id="content"></div>

Write a function that shows on the page a list of newspapers defined in a JavaScript array. Each link must be clickable.

```js
// Newspaper list
const newspapers = [
  'https://www.nytimes.com',
  'https://www.washingtonpost.com',
  'http://www.economist.com'
];
```
