1. Create a prompt pop-up that asks the user for a color.
2. Use the input color to change the background of the body, using DOM manipulation on the style property. Be sure to handle for invalid (non-color) inputs.
3. Using Javascript, add mouse-enter and mouse-leave event listeners on the div with the "element" id; change the text upon a hover-effect toggle.

## Hint

To change the background of an element we need to set the `element.style.background` property to the color we want.
