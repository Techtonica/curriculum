# Media Queries

Understanding media queries is a fundamental skill for front-end developers, as it allows them to create websites that provide a consistent and user-friendly experience across a variety of devices.

You are tasked with creating a responsive webpage that adjusts its layout and styling based on different screen sizes. To achieve this, your goal is to implement media queries in CSS.

### Instructions

1. Fork the provided starter code or create your own HTML file.
2. Set up the basic structure of the webpage with header, main content, and footer sections.
3. Apply initial styling to the webpage using CSS.
4. Implement media queries to adjust the layout and styling for different screen sizes:
    - Small screens: Max width 600px
    - Medium screens: Min width 601px and max width 1024px
    - Large screens: Min width 1025px

5. Test your responsive design by resizing your browser window or using developer tools to simulate various device sizes.
6. Optimize the styling to ensure readability and usability across different devices.

### REQUIREMENTS

- Create a simple HTML webpage with at least three sections: header, main content, and footer.
- Apply basic styling to the webpage, including background colors, font styles, and margins.
