## Week 4 - Pair Programming Exercises
- [Hello Component – React Props Practice](./hello-component)


##  Pair Programming

You are going to write a React component named `<Hello />`, and pass two properties into this component: `firstName` and `lastName`. When you run your program, your HTML should display:

> **"Hello, yourFirstName yourLastName"**

### Learning Goals

- Write and use functional React components
- Understand and use `props`
- Practice working in pairs using driver/navigator flow

---

## Hints

- For an example of how to do this, watch the React intro video from the GitHub lesson:  
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycstRj2i66k

- Reminder: **Properties (props)** in a React component are not the same as **parameters** in a regular function.

- Example output goal: `Hello, Taylor Swift`

## Live Demo

Want to experiment in a React environment? Try out the example live on CodeSandbox:

[CodeSandbox: Hello Component](https://codesandbox.io/s/techtonica-hi-component-vewdx3?file=/src/App.js:23-183)

## Async Instructions (if working solo)

If you're not pairing and working on your own:

- Read through the starter code in `App.js` and `Hello.js`
- Talk through your code steps out loud or write explanatory comments
- Treat yourself as both driver and navigator: explain what you're doing and why
- Try replacing the `firstName` and `lastName` values and observe what changes

---

## What To Submit

- A working `<Hello />` component that takes two props and renders the string  
  `"Hello, yourFirstName yourLastName"`
- Complete this in your local dev environment or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

_Happy coding!_
