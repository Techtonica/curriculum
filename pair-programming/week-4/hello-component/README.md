## Add your Name to a "Hello" React Component

You are going to write a React component named `<Hello />`, and pass two properties into this component: `firstName` and `lastName`. When you run your program, your HTML should display:

> **"Hello, yourFirstName yourLastName"**

### Learning Goals

- Write and use functional React components
- Understand and use `props`
- Practice working in pairs using driver/navigator flow

## Hints: Watch this [Intro to React Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycstRj2i66k)

- Reminder: **Properties (props)** in a React component are not the same as **parameters** in a regular function.
- Example output goal: `Hello, Taylor Swift`

## Live Demo

Experiment in a React environment with some example code: [Hello Component](https://codesandbox.io/s/techtonica-hi-component-vewdx3?file=/src/App.js:23-183)

## Async Instructions

If you're not pairing and working on your own:

- Read through the starter code in `App.js` and `Hello.js`
- Talk through your code steps out loud or write explanatory comments
- Treat yourself as both driver and navigator: explain what you're doing and why
- Try replacing the `firstName` and `lastName` values and observe what changes

## Final Outcome

- A working `<Hello />` component that takes two props and renders the string  
  `"Hello, yourFirstName yourLastName"`
- Complete this in your local dev environment or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

_Happy coding!_
