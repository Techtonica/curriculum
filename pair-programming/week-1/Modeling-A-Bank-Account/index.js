// Write a program that creates an `account` object with the following characteristics:
// * A `name` property.
// * A `balance` property set to 0
// * A `deposit` method adding the (positive or negative) value passed as an argument to the account balance.
// * A `describe` method that prints the account description in the console.
// * A `transfer` method with two parameters: the name of the account that will receive the transfer, and the amount of money to transfer.
