// Write a program that creates an `account` object with the following characteristics:
    // * A `name` property.
    // * A `balance` property set to 0 
  // * A `deposit` method adding the (positive or negative) value passed as an argument to the account balance.
  // * A `describe` method that prints the account description in the console.
  // * A `transfer` method with two parameters: the name of the account that will receive the transfer, and the amount of money to transfer. 

  
// ## Test
// - Create an account for Billy, Rosie, Jack and Jill
// - Give each of the accounts a deposit on money
// - Print a string describing the current amount of money on each account
// - Transfer positive values between Billy and Jack and negative values between Rosie and Jack
