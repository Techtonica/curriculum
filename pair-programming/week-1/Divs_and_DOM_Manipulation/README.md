# First Div

The goal of this mini webpage is to get used to creating sections and using basic HTML and CSS and practice DOM Manipulation

1. Make 3 or 4 `<div>`s (as many as are in your group). Put one of your names in an `<h2>` in each `<div>`
2. Add a paragraph within each div with your names in it. add "I live in **city**" using the `<strong>` tag to make the city bold
3. Make an unordered list with each of your names
4. In the list, add a <a> tag with the link to your favorite restaurant. Make sure the text of the link says the restuarnt name--!>

5. Try using JS DOM manipulation to change the text of the first li to "I'm learning JS"

6. Using DOM manipulation add one more li to the end of your list, with your favorite plate from your favorite restaurant
