Please note that this code is not working!

### Tasks

1. Complete the `RegisterYourCatForm` component so it does two things:

- Make the form work - meaning, catching the data from the user;
- Send the info for the cat to the parent componet

2. Using state `import {useState} from React` control the form component with the set function
3. Make the onSubmit function console.log the cat information (Hint: this is happening in the parent (App.js))
