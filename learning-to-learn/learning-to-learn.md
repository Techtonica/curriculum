# Learning to Learn

### Projected Time
About 90 minutes
- 45 minutes of videos
- 10 minutes for the Learning Style Quiz
- 10 minutes for the Growth Mindset Quiz
- 10 minutes for group activity
- 10 minutes for "Check for Understanding"

### Prerequisites
"Expectations While at Techtonica" lesson

### Learning styles represented

- See (videos and slides)
- Hear (videos and class discussion)
- Write (journal prompt to check for understanding)
- Do (take 2 quizzes)

### Motivation
Techtonica is an intensive learning program whose format puts emphasis on participant-led learning, unlike a traditional classroom setting which emphasizes instructor-led learning. It's important that participants understand some common limiting beliefs about learning, and work to free themselves of these beliefs to be more successful at Techtonica.
The tech industry is all about learning. When you open your mind to learn it gives you the freedom to work wherever you want because you learned the skills to get there!

### Objectives

- Their own learning style(s)

- What the Growth Mindset is and how to practice it

### Specific Things To Teach

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I only have one learning style."** Most people make use of several learning styles. Sometimes they rely heavily on one over others.
- **"I'm not good at learning new things because I didn't get good grades in school."** Ability to learn and grades earned in school are not strongly correlated. Grades reflect other things in addition to learning (persistence, ability to obtain help, ability to spend time on assignments, support at home, etc.)
- **"As long as I have a growth mindset, learning new things will be easy."** A growth mindset allows you to be kinder to and more patient with yourself when learning new things. Learning new things is often quite challenging, regardless of your mindset.

### Demonstration
**Instructor will demonstrate**:
- Setting a timer for the Pomodoro method

### Group Activity

Instructor will lead class through an exercise to write down some positive, affirmative things to say to oneself that fall under the framework of the growth mindset. 

Example: "I'm having difficulty absorbing this concept, but I have a lot of resources I can use to try coming at this from a different angle."
