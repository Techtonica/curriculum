<html>
<body>
	Animals:
	<ol id="ol1">
		<li>Frog</li>
		<li>Dog</li>
		<li>Bunny</li>
	</ol>

	<div id="id1">
		<p>This is the text in div id1</p>
		<p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
	</div>

	<p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

	<div class="myClass">
		I love learning about HTML and JavaScript
	</div>

	<p class="myClass">
		Coding is fun
	</p>

	<button id="button1">Button 1</button>
	<br/><br/>
	<button id="button2">Button 2</button>
</body>

<script type="text/javascript">

// Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"


// Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.


// Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.


// Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.


// Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.


// Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.


// Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.


// Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked, 
// an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".


// Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
//


// The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!

// Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
// Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.


// Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked, 
// the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100


// How was this exercise (easy, hard, fun, confusing)?
