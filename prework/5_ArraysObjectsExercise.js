// Week 3 - Arrays and Objects

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Make an empty array named animals

// Exercise 2. Add the string "frog" to the array

// Exercise 3. Add 4 more animals of your choice to the array. Try to add all of them in one line of code.

// Exercise 4. Update the first item in the array to be "gorilla"

// Exercise 5. Print the number of items in the array (use the array property that will give you this information)

// Exercise 6. Print the first item in the array

// Exercise 7. Print the last item in the array (as part of your answer, use the same array property you used in exercise 5 above)

// Exercise 8. Remove the last item from the array

// Exercise 9. Now make a new array named assortedThings that contains at least 3 strings and 3 numbers.

// Exercise 10. Write a for loop that iterates through the assortedThings array and prints each index and item, such as:
// Item #0 is potato
// Item #1 is 4
// Item #2 is Hello World
// ...

// Exercise 11. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter. For each number in the array,
// print the number and "BIG" if it's over 100, "small" if it's between 0 and 100, and "negative" if
// it's less than 0. Example:
// if the array is [-2, 200, 50], print:
// -2 negative
// 200 BIG
// 50 small
//
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

// Exercise 12. Make an object called me that contains the following keys: name, favoriteAnimal, favoriteNumber
// The values of those keys can be whatever you choose.

// Exercise 13. Add another 2 keys and values to the object (you choose what they are)

// Exercise 14. Update the favoriteAnimal value to something different

// Exercise 15. Print the value of favoriteAnimal.
// Note: there are at least 2 ways to get the value of a key, try to write both.

// Congrats, you made it to the end!
