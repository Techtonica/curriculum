<html>
  <body>
    Animals:
    <ol id="ol1">
      <li>Frog</li>
      <li>Dog</li>
      <li>Bunny</li>
    </ol>

    <div id="id1">
      <p>This is the text in div id1</p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
    </div>

    <p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

    <div class="myClass">
      I love learning about HTML and JavaScript
    </div>

    <p class="myClass">
      Coding is fun
    </p>

    <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
    <br /><br />
    <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
  </body>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"

    // Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.

    // Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.

    // Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.

    // Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.

    // Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.

    // Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.

    // Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked,
    // an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".

    // Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
    //

    // The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!

    // Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
    // Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.

    // Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked,
    // the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100

    // How was this exercise (easy, hard, fun, confusing)?
    // What references did you use to help?
