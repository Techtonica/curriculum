# Intro to Eventonica

Welcome to the Eventonica project!

In this project, you'll make a web app to manage events. Users of the site will be able to add and delete events, mark themselves as attending events, search for events, and see which events are most popular. You'll also add features to be able to import events from third-party websites like Ticketmaster.

You'll work on this project over the next 5 weeks. As you learn more web development technologies in the course, you'll integrate those technologies into the app. By the end you'll have built a full-stack web app that uses Node, Express, Postgres or MongoDB, and React.

Here's the progression you'll go through in building your app of the next 5 weeks:
- Build a version of the app with Javascript and jQuery. You'll use object-oriented programming and learn how to test your app.
- Learn about APIs and add API calls to the Ticketmaster APIs to your app.
- Learn about backend development and add a backend to your app. Now your app will be able to be deployed to the internet and be used by multiple users.
- Learn about Postgres and add a Postgres database to your app. Now you'll be able to save data long-term in a searchable format
- Learn about backend testing and add tests to make sure your app works as expected in a variety of situations.
- Learn about ORMs (object-relational mapping), another way for your backend code to interact with your database. Update your app to use an ORM.
- Learn about another database, MongoDB, and switch out Postgres for Mongo to store your data.
- Learn React and rewrite your frontend UI using React.
