### Part 1 - change your zsh profile

To help you get started, create an empty `.zshrc` file in your home directory like this:

    touch ~/.zshrc

You can add a definition for a single environment variable like this:

    echo "HELLO=WORLD" >> ~/.zshrc

And then apply the changes from your .zshrc with:

    source ~/.zshrc

Test the changes worked by checking the contents of the HELLO variable in your shell with:

    echo $HELLO
    WORLD

The value should be "WORLD". If you do not see the same output as above, retry
the steps and/or ask for help before trying the following steps below.

You should be using vim or another editor to edit your `.zshrc` file as you go.
If you want to use vim, see the references in Part 0 with an intro to vim
commands. If you do use vim, you can open `.zshrc` in vim from a terminal with
`vim ~/.zshrc` and proceed from there!

Make sure you have added at least one of each:

- [ ] a custom environment variable
- [ ] a new file to the \$PATH environmental variable
- [ ] a new terminal prompt
- [ ] a new alias

In your terminal, use the commands to prove your environment variable, \$PATH
file, and alias work. Make sure those lines and your custom prompt are in the
terminal window at the same time, and save a screen shot of it to show your
work.

### Part 2 - Set up a text file using only zsh and vim

- [ ] Use zsh to rename your screenshot 'name-zsh-profile.png', replacing 'name' with your first name.
- [ ] Use zsh to make a file called name-week-1-worksheet.txt, replacing 'name' with your name.
- [ ] Use only the vim editor to answer the following questions in your new file.

### Notes

- _zsh vs bash_: For a long time bash was the default shell on macs. As of
  MacOS Catalina, Apple [switched their default shell from Bash to
  Zsh](https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/56921-moving-from-bash-to-zsh-terminal-changes-in-macos-catalina/).
  This means you may see older resources which still refer to the shell in
  general as bash even though now on mac you will by default use Zsh. Most of the
  time this doesn't make a big difference but sometimes the distinction is
  important. For example if you want to set enviornment variables, an alias or a
  terminal prompt change for every time you start a new shell, you will need to
  do it in the `.zshrc` file not the `.bashrc` file because you are using zsh and
  not bash. See the suggested reading for more info.
