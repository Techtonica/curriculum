- [ ] In a seperate section, list a few coding experience entries and some past work experience that you can apply to a tech job.
- [ ] Add a title tag to your file.
- [ ] Double check that you have proper indentation for readability.
- [ ] Use semantic tags rather than presentational tags when possible. 

**Developer Tools**
- [ ] Inspect your page at least once using the Source Code Viewer

- [ ]  Include relevant ReadMe content.
- [ ]  Use markdown to organize your ReadMe.
-----

### Part 2 - Save it using your command line, Git, and deploy on Github

- [ ] Use git to check the diff of each changed file to be sure the changes are what you want.
- [ ] Add the changed files one at a time, commit with a short message about what you changed, and push to github.

**Go live with GitHub**
- [ ] Go into the settings of your portfolio-website repo in Github and create a link for your live site
- [ ] Make the link to your live github.io site clickable on your ReadMe.

### Extensions
- Spend what remains of your 3 hours to make improvements to your portfolio site, and be sure to push your changes up to github.
