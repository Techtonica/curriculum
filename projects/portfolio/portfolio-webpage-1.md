# Portfolio Project with HTML and CSS

### Addistional Skills

- VS Code
- Developer Tools
- Keyboard Shortcuts
- Web Patterns
- UI/UX
- GitHub for code storage and static-site hosting
- Ergonomics
- Writing a good README

### Primary Goals

To demonstrate understanding of the foundational topics covered in the first two weeks of Techtonica before diving further into the PERN stack.

1. Create a mew HTML/CSS webpage
2. Modify the contents of your page using DOM methods
3. Use common CSS rules to align content (left, right, center), modify colors, sizes of containers and text, etc.
4. Get comfortable using CSS media queries 

### Overview

In this project, you will build a simple portfolio page to practice what you've learned about VSCode, HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub. In the future, a great portfolio page will be valuable way to showcase your skills as you look for engineering work.

### Motivation

Increase your job prospects dramatically with your own personal web page. Get creative and show off your technical skills. Employers will love you!

### Project Checklist

**Ergonomics**

- [ ] Remember get up to stretch or walk for 5-10 minutes _every hour_. (Set an alarm)
- [ ] Each hour, check foot, knee, elbow, and spine position and correct if necessary. (Set an alarm)

**Create your project**

- [ ] Use bash to create a local portfolio-website directory. Use the command line to make an portfolio.html and an portfolio.css in the portfolio-website directory.
- [ ] Use the command line to change the names of portfolio.html and portfolio.css to index.html and index.css.
- [ ] Use the command line to make a gitignore file in your desktop directory and add at least one real unwanted file to the gitignore.
- [ ] Use the command line to move the gitignore file from your desktop directory to your portfolio-website directory.
- [ ] Using your command line, initialize a github repo in portfolio-website.
- [ ] Create a remote repo for the project in your github account.
- [ ] Using your command line, add and commit your portfolio-website directory, and then do a git push.
- [ ] Open your portfolio-website directory in VS Code using your command line.
- [ ] Increase or decrease your VSCode text size before starting.
- [ ] Open your VSCode Integrated Terminal, and close your terminal/command line program.
- [ ] Add a linting extension to VSCode. You are welcome to keep or remove it after trying it out.

**HTML**

- [ ] Use VS Code shortcuts to create boilerplate code for your html file.
- [ ] Open and view your html file in Chrome using only the VSCode application.
- [ ] Make a basic header for your online resume - your name and a short description of your experience.
- [ ] In a seperate section, list a few coding experience entries and some past work experience that you can apply to a tech job.
- [ ] Add a title tag to your file.
- [ ] Double check that you have proper indentation for readability.
- [ ] Use semantic tags rather than presentational tags when possible.
- [ ] (Remember to make a git commit after each set of code changes!)
- [ ] (Second half of week) - Add a contact form with the following fields: name (required), email (required), phone number (not required), and address (not required) (Hint: Required fields in a form are those where you normally see a \* symbol)

**Developer Tools**

- [ ] Inspect your page at least once using the Source Code Viewer
- [ ] Inspect your page at least once using the Quick Source Viewer Chrome Extension
- [ ] Access the JavaScript console at least once to check your page for errors and warnings.

**CSS**

- [ ] Link your index.css file to index.html.
- [ ] Style your text using at least 3 different properties.

**Media Queries, UI, UX**

- [ ] Have at least one style change each for a narrow, medium, and wide browswer window.
- [ ] Use developer tools at least once to inspect your styles and check window width.
- [ ] Make sure the User Interface of your site is appealing at all widths while keeping it simple.
- [ ] Ask a peer to test your site and tell you about their experience. Change one thing that would provide better UX.

**README**

- [ ] Include relevant README content (what the project is, what open-source license it uses, how to install, etc.).
- [ ] Use markdown to organize your README.

### Recommended extension activity if time permits

- [ ] Move your portfolio project into its own repo instead of within the techtonica-assignments repo
- [ ] Go into the settings of your portfolio-website repo in GitHub and create a link for your live site
- [ ] Make the link to your live github.io site clickable on your README.
