### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- bash

### Frameworks

- Bootstrap

### Other Skills

- VS Code
- Developer Tools
- Keyboard Shortcuts
- Web Patterns
- UI/UX
- GitHub for code storage and static-site hosting
- Ergonomics
- Writing a good README

### Primary Goals

To demonstrate understanding of the topics covered in the first two weeks of this course.

### Overview

In this project, you will build a simple portfolio page to practice what you've learned about VSCode, HTML, CSS, Git, and Bootstrap. This should take about 3 hours.

### Context

- A great portfolio page will be valuable way to showcase your skills as you look for engineering work.
- After you've learned more coding skills and tools, you will be making this site even better.
- Include your new coding skills in your resume!

### Motivation

Increase your job prospects dramatically with your own personal web page. Get creative and show off your technical skills. Employers will love you!
Here's a list of example portfolios

### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this project. You can do it!

## Project Requirements:

- [ ] As you go through the lesson, commit your code in git and push to GitHub after each bolded section (or more frequently if you want). You should write clear + informative commit messages for each commit.

### Part 1 - Build your amazing portfolio page in with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

**Ergonomics**

- [ ] Remember get up to stretch or walk for 5-10 minutes _every hour_. (Set an alarm)
- [ ] Each hour, check foot, knee, elbow, and spine position and correct if necessary. (Set an alarm)

**Create your project**

- [ ] Use bash to create a local portfolio-website directory. Use the command line to make an portfolio.html and an portfolio.css in the portfolio-website directory.
- [ ] Use the command line to change the names of portfolio.html and portfolio.css to index.html and index.css.
- [ ] Use the command line to make a gitignore file in your desktop directory and add at least one real unwanted file to the gitignore.
- [ ] Use the command line to move the gitignore file from your desktop directory to your portfolio-website directory.
- [ ] Using your command line, initialize a github repo in portfolio-website.
- [ ] Create a remote repo for the project in your github account.
- [ ] Using your command line, add and commit your portfolio-website directory, and then do a git push.
- [ ] Open your portfolio-website directory in VS Code using your command line.
- [ ] Increase or decrease your VSCode text size before starting.
- [ ] Open your VSCode Integrated Terminal, and close your terminal/command line program.
- [ ] Add a linting extension to VSCode. You are welcome to keep or remove it after trying it out.

**HTML**

- [ ] Use VS Code shortcuts to create boilerplate code for your html file.
- [ ] Open and view your html file in Chrome using only the VSCode application.
- [ ] Make a basic header for your online resume - your name and a short description of your experience.
- [ ] In a seperate section, list a few coding experience entries and some past work experience that you can apply to a tech job.
- [ ] Add a title tag to your file.
- [ ] Double check that you have proper indentation for readability.
- [ ] Use semantic tags rather than presentational tags when possible.
- [ ] (Remember to make a git commit after each set of code changes!)

**Developer Tools**

- [ ] Inspect your page at least once using the Source Code Viewer
- [ ] Inspect your page at least once using the Quick Source Viewer Chrome Extension
- [ ] Access the JavaScript console at least once to check your page for errors and warnings.

**CSS**

- [ ] Link your index.css file to index.html.
- [ ] Style your text using at least 3 different properties.
- [ ] Add and style a profile photo of yourself. Include a border.
- [ ] Have some info in a second column
- [ ] Use one "id" correctly.
- [ ] Select 3 web design patterns to implement
- [ ] Use your search bar at least once to jump to an element or style.
- [ ] Have 2 css blocks that include the class "override" with one overriding the other rule in an obvious way.
- [ ] Change the display property of at least one element.

**Bootstrap**

- [ ] Link bootstrap to index.html file.
- [ ] Create a _navigation bar_ that includes your name as the _page title_, and at least two _links_ including your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile.
- [ ] Use at least two Bootstrap tags or classes to style your nav bar.

**Media Queries, UI, UX**

- [ ] Have at least one style change each for a narrow, medium, and wide browswer window.
- [ ] Use developer tools at least once to inspect your styles and check window width.
- [ ] Make sure the User Interface of your site is appealing at all widths while keeping it simple.
- [ ] Ask a peer to test your site and tell you about their experience. Change one thing that would provide better UX.

**README**

- [ ] Create a README.md file with your command line.
- [ ] Include relevant README content (what the project is, what open-source license it uses, how to install, etc.).
- [ ] Use markdown to organize your README.

---

### Part 2 - Go live with GitHub

- [ ] Commit and push any uncommitted changes to GitHub
- [ ] Go into the settings of your portfolio-website repo in GitHub and create a link for your live site
- [ ] Make the link to your live github.io site clickable on your README.

### Extensions

- Spend what remains of your 3 hours to make improvements to your portfolio site, and be sure to push your changes up to github.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- We can add common FAQs here. Open a GitHub issue or PR if you have any questions.
