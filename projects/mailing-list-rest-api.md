# Mailing List REST API

This is an activity designed to follow the [REST API topic](/api/REST-API.md)

## Tools

You should create an Express app. All of this can be in-memory, no database or file storage needed.

## Data

The data consists of mailing lists which have a name and an array of member email addresses.

```json
{
  "name": "staff",
  "members": ["talea@techtonica.org", "michelle@techtonica.org"]
}
```

## Routes

### Index

#### Route

`/lists` - fetch all the existing list names

#### Response

- 200 with a JSON body of all the existing list names
- 200 and empty array if none exist (not a 404)

#### Response Body

```json
["staff", "cohort-h1-2020"]
```

#### Example Express Code

```javascript
const lists = new Map();
// see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map

// add some fake data

app.get('/lists', (req, res) => {
  const listsArray = Array.from(lists.keys()); // Why is this like this? Try it out in your console.
  res.send(listsArray);
});
```

### GET single list

#### Route

`/lists/:name` - get list by name, e.g. `/lists/staff`

#### Response

- 200 with a JSON body (name and member emails) of the given list
- 404 if not found

#### Response Body

```json
{
  "name": "staff",
  "members": ["talea@techtonica.org", "michelle@techtonica.org"]
}
```

### DELETE single list

#### Route

`/lists/:name` - delete list by name

##### Response

- 200 if successfully deleted
- 404 if not found to delete

#### Response Body

None needed

### PUT - update single list

#### Path

`/lists/:name` - add or update a list with the given name

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "my-new-list",
  "members": ["me@me.com"]
}
```

#### Response

- 200 if it updated a list that already existed
- 201 if it created a new list

#### Response Body

None

#### Optional Extension

What if the name in the path doesn't match the one in JSON body?? Sounds like an error case to me. Detect this case and pick an [appropriate status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_errors). (hint: if the client did something wrong in the request, it'll be 4xx)

## Testing

Use Postman to test retrieving, saving, and deleting mailing lists using your API.

## Bonus Extension

Some would say the more REST-ful way to manage the members of the list is to make them into a resource.

After creating your pull request in your assignments repo, try this challenge!

- `GET /lists/:name/members` => return array of emails only for a list
- `PUT /lists/:name/members/:email` => make the supplies email a member of the list
- `DELETE /lists/:name/members/:email` => remove the supplied email as a member of the list

### Sidebar PUT vs. POST

API's often use POST and PUT for updates. They have slightly different meanings. This [side-by-side comparison](https://restfulapi.net/rest-put-vs-post/) can be helpful but don't get too hung up on that at this stage.

- `POST /lists/:name/members` with a body containing an email will add it to the list, even if it's already there
