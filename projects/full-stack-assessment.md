# Full Stack Assessment

## Format

- **Timed** - you will have from the end of standup to 4:30pm to submit (in your private assessments repo)
- Googling is allowed and expected
  - you can also use your own past code, assignment code of peers, Bill's example code to help
- Asking for help in the main apprentices channel, e.g. a strange compilation issue
- _What is not allowed?_
  - Asking for help in #tech-help or any channel, both public or private
    - Feel free to ask for help in our apprentices channel
  - Pairing with your mentor or sharing the assessment code with them before you have submitted it
  - Pairing with another apprentice
  - Asking other apprentices for their specific solution to the assessment
  - Using code that you didn't write and don't really understand
    - You can use setup and troubleshooting guides which of course contain small code snippets
    - (And yes this is subjective but I trust you will follow the spirit of it)

## Requirements

- Clone an existing project
  - React frontend
  - Express API
  - Postgres database
- Add a features which will require

  - New/modified React UI
  - New database column(s) or table(s)
  - New/modified Express API

## How to Prepare

- The [full stack app project](./mern-pern-project.md) is the best practice
- Adding a feature to Eventonica with React is also helpful
  - If you were not able to fully complete it, clone a fully working example and practice adding a new database column or other feature
