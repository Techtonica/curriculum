# Full Stack Assessment

## Format
- **Timed** - you will have from the end of standup to 4:30pm to submit (in your private assessments repo)
- Googling is allowed and expected
  - aside from just googline problems please use your own past code, assignment code of peers, Bill's code to help
- Asking for help in the main apprentices channel, e.g. a strange compilation issue
- What is not allowed?
  - Asking for help in #tech-help - we'll keep it all in the apprentices channel
  - Pairing with your mentor
  - Pairing with another apprentice
  - Asking other apprentices for their specific solution to the assessment
