# Project - React Game

### Introduction

You've now learned enough React to create a game! This project is to practice fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.

### General guidelines for projects:

You are welcome to rewrite the game you made last week in React or to make a different one.

Here are some [examples](https://bg.reactjs.org/community/examples.html).
\*Please note that although the projects are still useful to look through, this React website is outdated. [Here](https://react.dev/learn) is the newest React site to view documentation as well as an example [Tic-Tac-Toe game tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) for extra practice.

**Please do not select hangman because of its racist origins.**

**Kindly avoid choosing the BMI calculator from the examples provided above, as it may be associated with sensitive issues such as racism and sizeism.**

We encourage you to use git version control and GitHub to save your progress as you build up your work. This way you can test React out in your local text editors.

### Minimum Requirements

- Write a game of your choosing in React
- Make sure you practice components, props, and state
  - Have some sort of input that you receive from one component that you pass to another (such as number of tries, hi/low number, etc.)
  - Have some sort of counter that uses the useState hook to update the score or count to the screen
- Commit your code at least 15 times
- Submit at least 1 PR by the end of the week

#### Optional Extension Activity

If you have extra time, consider [hosting your game on GitHub Pages](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-host-your-react-app-on-github-pages-for-free-919ad201a4cb).
