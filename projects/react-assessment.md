## Assessment #9.0: Add a feature to your eventonica-react app

### Languages

- JS

### Frameworks

- React

### Libraries/ Tools

- Jest
- Enzyme

### Primary Goals

Demonstrate understanding of React, Enzyme, and Jest by adding a feature to your eventonica-react UI.

### Overview

In this project, you will have 4 hours to **display the attendees of an event** throughout your React/Postgres eventonica-react app.

### Basic Requirements

1. You can do online research, but do not share knowledge with other participants today.
2. Your project is due in 4 hours.

## Setup Instructions

- [ ] Create a new branch called "attendees", and add all your changes there. Push your new branch up to GitHub.

## Project Instructions

---

#### React & Enzyme

- [ ] Plan out the user's journey:
  - where will they find the event attendee feature? where would they look for it?
  - how will the data be organized?
  - will the user need do perform an action to make the data visible?
  - will the data stay on the page, or can it be closed/minimized?
- [ ] Present and style your new data somewhere in the UI using React. Functionality should take priority over beauty.
- [ ] Add shallow and mount testing with Enzyme and Jest for your new elements.
      ** Use any extra time to improve test coverage and add polish. You will be deploying this project next week.
      ** Commit early and often, with useful commit messages.

#### Submit your project

- [ ] Your project and new feature must run.
- [ ] Note any updates to run instructions in your branch's README.md.
- [ ] Do not merge "attendees" to your main branch. Push up your final changes, and send the URL of your updated project to your Program Manager.
