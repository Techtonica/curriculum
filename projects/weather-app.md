# Week 7 Build a Minimal APP connecting backend and frontend  Project

### Frameworks

- Backend: ExpressJS
- Frontend: React (we suggest that you use create-react-app)

### Libraries/Tools

- NodeJS 
- Express
- Postman
- Create-React-APP
- Fetch

### Primary Goals

This assignment will check for proficiency in: NodeJS, ExpressJS, and how connect your backend with the frontend

(We will cover Database, API testing, and CRUD in future assessments.)

### Overview

In this project, you will build a minimal Weather App connecting your backend and your frontend. 

Win #1 
The weather app should have all the basic functions including: city name, current weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. 

Win #2
It should display the icon images for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy weather conditions. 

Win #3
It should have a responsive design.

### Context

- After learning Node, Express, and API concepts (Fetch),  you will use them to connect with a external API in the Backend. - We recommend that you use OpenWeather API ï»¿https://openweathermap.org/api
- You will use React to show the results of the API fetch to your frontend 

# Project Instructions

## Part 0 - Starter Code
### For the Backend
- [ ] Create your main directory for this project. Initialize this project folder for git, and get a new remote GitHub repo ready so you can save and push as you make progress on your project. You will be submitting your GitHub repo link once you finish.
- [ ] Inside the main folder of your project create a server folder 
- [ ] Inside the server folder setup a basic express server

### For the Frontend
- [ ] Inside the main folder of your project create a folder called client
- [ ] Inside your client folder initialize a create-react-app server in React 
- [ ] Return back to the main folder and create a .gitignore file. Add `*node_modules` to it, and save.

## Part 1 - Connecting the API in the backend
- [ ] Inside the server folder in your server.js file do a fetch request to the Weather API

## Part 2 - Connecting the API in the frontend
- [ ] Inside the client folder in your script.js file do a fetch request to bring the data fron the backend
- [ ] Render the weather infomation inside a component
