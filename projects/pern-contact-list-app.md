# Full-Stack PERN Project: Contact List App

### Introduction

Let's make a contact list app! You've now learned how to create a full-stack app with a React frontend, Node/Express backend, and Postgres database (PERN). This project is to practice putting it all together by building a fairly simple app from start to finish.

For this project, you can reference previous lessons and find your own resources online. This should be good practice finding resources and getting the help you need to make your code work without step-by-step instructions.

You must use Express, React, and PostgreSQL. You can choose what other technologies and libraries you want to use as well as part of the project.

All code should be your own or _become your own_, i.e. you should understand what it's doing, even if it's a snippet from StackOverflow. If you get an idea from somewhere or someone, please add an attribution note in a comment.

Styling/CSS is not important for this assignment, but once the behavior is working, please feel free to make it look nice.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ _**Avoid searching “tutorial for how to make a contact list app” and following step by step instructions. Your final project will NOT have any tutorials, so get familiar with how things work together now!**_

#### Backend

- Use SQL to add some initial data to your database - a minimum of 3 contacts should be initially populated in your app.
- Your DB should have a table "contacts" with at least these columns:
  - Contact ID
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Notes

#### Frontend.

Please make sure that your components in the React app have the following distribution:

- Home (App) - Parent
- contacts - Child - Renders a list with all your contacts.
- view-contact - child - Renders the info of ONE individual contact
- create-contact- child - Renders a form for the user to add a new contact
