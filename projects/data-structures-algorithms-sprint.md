## Data Structures and Algorithms Sprint (2-3 Weeks)

Quick links: [Group Topics](#group-topics) | [Schedule](#schedule) | [Deliverables](#deliverables)

Data structures and algorithms are the core building blocks of all code. This sprint is expanded to span approximately 2-3 weeks, allowing each group to thoroughly work through all the DSA topics in sequence rather than just focusing on a single topic.

## Expectations

**You are not expected to be experts on these topics immediately**. This material is usually covered in 1-2 semesters of a Computer Science undergraduate degree. Almost all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms, so having a strong foundation in these concepts will significantly help your career prospects. We're introducing these concepts gradually to allow you time to practice and build expertise over several weeks.

## Group Presentation

Each group will deliver a ~30-minute presentation on their assigned topic, with each group member contributing during the presentation. The presentation should include:

1.  **Technical Depth**
    - What are the unique properties of it? (Big O Notation, etc)
    - What makes the concept useful?
    - Practical use cases, how to use the concept, and real-world application.
    - Include interactive elements of at least 10 visuals
2. **Code Examples and Demos**
   - Provide hands-on coding demonstrations
   - Show practical implementations of key concepts
   - Challenge your attendees with a brief prompt
       - encourage them to work on the solution independently
       - offer your support to answer any questions
       - the prompt should be solvable in <30mins
       - prepare small hints to give throughout the 30 mins for encouragement
3. **Best Practices and Pitfalls**
   - Discuss common mistakes and how to avoid them
   - Highlight best practices specific to the technology
   - Address performance optimization tips
   - Address common misconceptions or doubts
4. **Continued Learning**
    - share three async prompts for others to solve
       - each group member should send their individual prompt solutions ahead of your presentation to the STEM
       - each prompt should be solvable in 30-60 mins
       - each attendee will choose a single prompt to solve and turn in a a solution to the STEM
5. **Additional Resources**
    - Include any videos, code challenges, or blogs that your group found helpful.

### Individual Assessment

Complete the tasks outlined in the [Data Structures and Algorithms Assessment](data-structures-algorithms-assessment.md). This involves explaining various data structures and algorithms in a private gist.
