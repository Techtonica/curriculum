## Data Structures and Algorithms (Week 11)

Quick links: [Deliverables](#deliverables) | [Schedule](#schedule)

It is during the Data Structures and Algorithms Week that you will start to learn about data structures and algorithms, which are the core building blocks of all code.

## Expectations

**You are not expected to be experts on these topics by the end of the week**. This material is usually covered in 1-2 semesters of a Computer Science undergraduate degree. Almost all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms so having knowledge of these concepts will help you. We are starting this in advance so you are introduced to these concepts and can continue to practice in the coming weeks.

> Scope note: This sprint is tailored for the 5-month cohort timeline. Material previously taught in month 6 is introduced in Week 11 here.

## Teamwork and Topics

This sprint will also help you practice study skills, summarizing, teamwork, and presenting. You will be split into groups and assigned different topics to study and introduce in a presentation.

### All Groups

All groups should review:

- [Intro to Data Structures](../data-structures/intro-to-data-structures.md)
- [Intro to Algorithms](../algorithms/intro-to-algorithms.md)

### Group Topics

#### Group A - Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists

- [Stacks](../data-structures/stack.md)
- [Queues](../data-structures/queues.md)
- [Linked Lists](../data-structures/linked-lists.md)

For the most important items to teach and learn, see [Objectives 11](../objectives/11.md#stacks--queues--linked-lists).

#### Group B - Trees ðŸŒ²

- [Trees](../data-structures/trees.md)
  - [Depth-First and Breadth-First Searches](../algorithms/searching.md#materials)
  - Tries
- [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) - A special type of tree that lets you keep an ordered set of items and quickly access the max (or min) (aka Max-heap, Min-heap)

For the most important items to teach and learn, see [Objectives 11](../objectives/11.md#trees)

#### Group C - Hash Tables (aka Map, HashMap, Dict, etc)

- [Hash Tables](../data-structures/hash-tables.md)
- [JS Map](../javascript/javascript-maps.md) - Lookup values in O(1)
- [JS Set](../javascript/javascript-maps.md#set) - basically a Map with only keys (no values), items are present or not

For the most important items to teach and learn, see [Objectives 11](../objectives/11.md#hash-table)

#### Group D - Array Sorting/Searching

- [Array Sorting](../algorithms/sorting.md)
- [Linear & Binary Searching](../algorithms/searching.md#materials)

For the most important items to teach and learn, see [Objectives 11](../objectives/11.md#array-sortingsearching)

## Deliverables

### Group Presentation

Each group will deliver a ~30-minute presentation on their assigned topic. The presentation should include:

*   **Slides TL;DR:**
    *   ~30 minutes worth of slides (including solution walkthrough).
    *   5 code challenges:
        *   1 you walkthrough the solution of.
        *   1 you give the others time to start after your slides and are available for help.
        *   3 additional for others to practice - your group solves in advance and sends solutions to the SEAM.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Basics of each part of the topic:**
        *   What makes the concept useful?
        *   What are the unique properties of it? (Big O Notation, etc)
        *   Example of a use case.
    *   How to use the concept.
    *   At least 10 visuals (can be original or found on the internet).
    *   **A short code exercise walkthrough:**
        *   Show a code challenge and present your group's solution.
        *   Explain each line of code and how you came up with the solution.
        *   This can be done in VSCode (Google Slides does not highlight code well).
    *   **Additional resources slide at the end:**
        *   Include any videos, code challenges, or blogs that your group found helpful.
    *   **One post-slides code challenge:**
        *   After the presentation portion ends, give everyone 30 min to work on the first code challenge.
        *   In terms of difficulty, it should be solvable in <30min.
        *   Be available to answer questions on a Zoom Q&A call.
        *   Have hints prepared for the challenge to give, if needed.
    *   **An additional 3 code challenges for everyone to practice (at the end of the presentation and later):**
        *   Send solutions to all 3 from your group to the SEAM prior to your presentation.
        *   In terms of difficulty, they should take between 30-60min to solve.
        *   All other participants will have to choose one of yours to be homework over the weekend, to be turned into the SEAM.

### Individual Assessment

Complete the tasks outlined in the [Data Structures and Algorithms Assessment](data-structures-algorithms-assessment.md). This involves explaining various data structures and algorithms in a private gist.

## Schedule

### Day 1: Big O Notation and Array-Based Data Structures

*   **Morning:** Introduction to Big O Notation.
*   **Activity:**
    *   Analyze the runtime complexity of common operations.
    *   Introduction to array-based data structures.
*   **Homework:**
    *   Review runtime complexity ([topic outline](../runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md) and [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZcOdekB_aP59huZdp4X0u6EfUJKgxzK7y8LqCmzSLC8)).

### Day 2: Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues

*   **Activity:**
    *   Introduction to Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
    *   Implement the basic operations for each data structure.
*   **Homework:**
    *   Complete practice problems for Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

### Day 3: Deeper Dive and Presentation Prep

*   **Activity:**
    *   Research your topic in more depth.
    *   Decide how to divide tasks for the presentation.
*   **Researching Tips:**
    *   Many data structures examples will be in Java - it will be harder to find JS resources.
    *   It would be helpful to review our earlier lesson, [Giving Presentations](../giving-presentations/giving-presentations.md).

### Day 4: Group Work on Presentations

*   **Activity:** Work on presentations as a group.

### Day 5: Presentations

*   **Afternoon:** All groups will practice and then present their topics. The SEAM will send invites.
*   See Deliverables section above for presentation requirements.

### Day 5: Presentations Conclude and Practice

*   **Activity:**
    *   Presentations conclude.
    *   Work on the code challenges given by each group.
    *   Ask the group for help/hints if you can't solve them.
    *   Turn in all required code challenge code in your assignment repos as a PR before retro starts.
