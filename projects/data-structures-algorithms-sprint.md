## Data Structures and Algorithms Sprint

It is during the Data Structures and Algorithms Sprint that you will start to learn about data structures and algorithms, which are programming concepts that can be utilized to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of your code. You are not expected to be experts on these topics by the end of the sprint. Though not all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms, many do, and having knowledge of these concepts can help you stand out as an applicant.  

This sprint will also help you practice study skills, summarizing, teamwork, and presenting. You will be split into groups and assigned different topics to study and introduce in a presentation.

### Tools Needed
- [A 'Cracking the Coding Interview' book](https://www.pdfdrive.com/cracking-the-coding-interview-e52072841.html)  

### Schedule

#### Day 1
In the morning, the Program Facilitator will give a quick introduction to data structures, split you into groups, and assign two data structures and three algorithms topics per group.Thegroup members compare notes about topics, start creating introductory slides, and decide who will present what. groups will plan out demos, select beginner exercises and resources, polish slides, and practice presenting their introductory topic overviews (remember that reading is discouraged and eye contact and a loud, confident voice are encouraged).

Homework: read about your assigned data structures topics, highlight or outline the most important parts, and review runtime complexity ([topic outline](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md), [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZcOdekB_aP59huZdp4X0u6EfUJKgxzK7y8LqCmzSLC8), [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZoHxJMUiKOKPqu69vX3b_aeYGlDlRL6n)). 
Groups will prepare introductory overviews to topics in this order:

1. Stacks
2. Queues
3. Deques
4. Linked lists
5. Hash tables
6. Trees

#### Day 2
All the groups will practice and then present the Data structure topics at the end of the day:
1. Stacks
2. Queues
3. Deques
4. Linked lists
5. Hash tables
6. Trees

#### Day 3
Prepare Algorithms:
- Intro to Algorithm
- Searching: Binary
- Searching: Depth and Breadth
- Sorting: Bubble
- Sorting: Merge
- Sorting: Quick
- Sorting: Selection and Insertion

#### Day 4
All the groups will practice the algorithms and then present it at the end of the day.


### Introductory Overview Presentations Requirements
Presentations and exercises should be 40-45 minutes and must include:
- Google slides that give an overview
- A title slide
- The history of the concept
- A summary of what the concept is and why to use it
- How to use the concept
- At least 10 images or videos
- Big O notation and runtime details, if applicable
- Additional resources
- A code demo
- Several exercises for everyone to practice (at end of presentation and later)
- A slide about the presenters
