## Data Structures and Algorithms (Weeks 6-18)

Quick links: [Topics Overview](#topics-overview) | [Weekly Structure](#weekly-structure) | [Deliverables](#deliverables)

Data structures and algorithms are the core building blocks of all code. Throughout these weeks, you will progressively learn about various data structures and algorithms concepts that are crucial for technical interviews and practical software development.

> Scope note: This curriculum is tailored for the 5-month cohort timeline, with DSA content spread across multiple weeks rather than condensed into a single sprint.

## Expectations

**You are not expected to be experts on these topics immediately**. This material is usually covered in 1-2 semesters of a Computer Science undergraduate degree. Almost all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms, so having a strong foundation in these concepts will significantly help your career prospects. We're introducing these concepts gradually to allow you time to practice and build expertise over several weeks.

> Scope note: This sprint is tailored for the 5-month cohort timeline. Material previously taught in month 6 is introduced in Week 11 here.

## Weekly Structure

Each week follows a similar structure to ensure consistent learning and practice:

1. **Introduction to Concepts** - Introduction lecture covering the week's topic
2. **Group Activities** - Small group work on problem-solving using the week's concepts
3. **Practice Problems** - Individual and pair programming on targeted exercises
4. **Review Sessions** - Group discussions to review solutions and clarify concepts
5. **Weekly Assessment** - Brief assessment to verify understanding of material

> Note: With approximately 20 cohort participants, students will typically be divided into about 5 DSA topic groups each week for collaborative learning and problem-solving.

## Deliverables

### Group Presentation

Each group will deliver a ~30-minute presentation on their assigned topic. The presentation should include:

*   **Slides TL;DR:**
    *   ~30 minutes worth of slides (including solution walkthrough).
    *   5 code challenges:
        *   1 you walkthrough the solution of.
        *   1 you give the others time to start after your slides and are available for help.
        *   3 additional for others to practice - your group solves in advance and sends solutions to the SEAM.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Basics of each part of the topic:**
        *   What makes the concept useful?
        *   What are the unique properties of it? (Big O Notation, etc)
        *   Example of a use case.
    *   How to use the concept.
    *   At least 10 visuals (can be original or found on the internet).
    *   **A short code exercise walkthrough:**
        *   Show a code challenge and present your group's solution.
        *   Explain each line of code and how you came up with the solution.
        *   This can be done in VSCode (Google Slides does not highlight code well).
    *   **Additional resources slide at the end:**
        *   Include any videos, code challenges, or blogs that your group found helpful.
    *   **One post-slides code challenge:**
        *   After the presentation portion ends, give everyone 30 min to work on the first code challenge.
        *   In terms of difficulty, it should be solvable in <30min.
        *   Be available to answer questions on a Zoom Q&A call.
        *   Have hints prepared for the challenge to give, if needed.
    *   **An additional 3 code challenges for everyone to practice (at the end of the presentation and later):**
        *   Send solutions to all 3 from your group to the SEAM prior to your presentation.
        *   In terms of difficulty, they should take between 30-60min to solve.
        *   All other participants will have to choose one of yours to be homework over the weekend, to be turned into the SEAM.

### Individual Assessment

Complete the tasks outlined in the [Data Structures and Algorithms Assessment](data-structures-algorithms-assessment.md). This involves explaining various data structures and algorithms in a private gist.
