## Data Structures and Algorithms Sprint

It is during the Data Structures and Algorithms Sprint that you will start to learn about data structures and algorithms, which are programming concepts that can be utilized to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of your code. You are not expected to be experts on these topics by the end of the sprint. Though not all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms, many do, and having knowledge of these concepts can help you stand out as an applicant.  

This sprint will also help you practice study skills, summarizing, teamwork, and presenting. You will be split into groups and assigned different topics to study and introduce in a presentation.

### Schedule

#### Day 1
In the morning, the Program Facilitator will give a quick introduction to data structures, split you into groups, and assign two data structures and three algorithms topics per group. Homework: read about your assigned data structures topics, highlight or outline the most important parts, and review runtime complexity ([topic outline](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md), [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZcOdekB_aP59huZdp4X0u6EfUJKgxzK7y8LqCmzSLC8), [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZoHxJMUiKOKPqu69vX3b_aeYGlDlRL6n)). 

#### Day 2 
In the morning, group members compare notes about topics, start creating introductory slides, and decide who will present what. In the afternoon, groups will plan out demos, select beginner exercises and resources, polish slides, and practice presenting their introductory topic overviews (remember that reading is discouraged and eye contact and a loud, confident voice are encouraged).

#### Day 3 
Groups will present introductory overviews to topics in this order:

1. Stacks
2. Queues
3. Deques
4. Linked lists
5. Hash tables
6. Trees

#### Day 4
You will review what you’ve learned so far and practice the exercises for each data structure. Homework for the evening: read about your assigned algorithms topics and highlight or outline the most important parts.

#### Day 5
In the morning, group members compare notes about algorithms topics, start creating introductory slides, and decide who will present what. In the afternoon, groups will plan out demos, select beginner exercises and resources, polish slides, and practice presenting their introductory topic overviews (remember that reading is discouraged and eye contact and a loud, confident voice are encouraged).

#### Day 6
Groups will present introductory overviews to topics in this order:

1. Searching: Binary
2. Searching: Depth and Breadth

#### Day 7
Groups will present introductory overviews to topics in this order:

1. Sorting: Bubble
2. Sorting: Merge
3. Sorting: Quick
4. Sorting: Selection and Insertion


### Introductory Overview Presentations Requirements
Presentations and exercises should be 40-45 minutes and must include:
- Google slides that give an overview
- A title slide
- The history of the concept
- A summary of what the concept is and why to use it
- How to use the concept
- At least 10 images or videos
- Big O notation and runtime details, if applicable
- Additional resources
- A code demo
- Several exercises for everyone to practice (at end of presentation and later)
- A slide about the presenters
