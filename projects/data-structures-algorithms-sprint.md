## Data Structures and Algorithms

It is during the Data Structures and Algorithms Week that you will start to learn about data structures and algorithms, which are the core building blocks of all code.

## Expectations
**You are not expected to be experts on these topics by the end of the week**. This material is usually covered in 1-2 semesters of a Computer Science undergraduate degree. Almost all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms so having knowledge of these concepts will help you. We are starting this in advance so you are introduced to these concepts and can continue to practice in the coming weeeks.

## Teamwork
This sprint will also help you practice study skills, summarizing, teamwork, and presenting. You will be split into groups and assigned different topics to study and introduce in a presentation.

### Topics

All groups should review [Intro to Data Structures](../data-structures/intro-to-data-structures.md)

### Group A - Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists 
- [Stacks](../data-structures/stack.md)
- [Queues](../data-structures/queues.md)
- [Linked Lists](../data-structures/linked-lists.md)

### Group B - Trees 🌲
- [Trees](../data-structures/trees.md)
  - [Depth-First and Breadth-First Searches](../algorithms/searching.md#materials)
- Trees are everywhere (the DOM, your Filesystem)
- Trees are the No. 1 place you find recursion since they are by nature recursive. Every sub-tree is also a tree and its sub-tree is a tree...it's trees all the way down.
- [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) - A special type of tree that let's you keep an ordered set of items and quickly access the max (or min)

### Group C - Hash Tables (aka Map, HashMap, Dict, etc)
- [Hash Tables](../data-structures/hash-tables.md)
- [JS Map](../javascript/javascript-maps.md) - Lookup values in O(1)
- [JS Set](../javascript/javascript-maps.md#set) - basically a Map with only keys (no values), items are present or not

### Group D - Array Sorting/Searching
- [Array Sorting](../algorithms/sorting.md)
- [Linear & Binear Searching](../algorithms/searching.md#materials)


### Schedule

#### Day 1

In the morning, the SEAM will assign you to one of the above groups. The group members should study individually and then come together to compare notes about topics, start creating introductory slides, and decide who will present what. groups will plan out demos, select beginner exercises and resources, polish slides, and practice presenting their introductory topic overviews (remember that reading is discouraged and eye contact and a loud, confident voice are encouraged).


Homework: read about your assigned data structures topics, highlight or outline the most important parts, and review runtime complexity ([topic outline](../runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md), [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZcOdekB_aP59huZdp4X0u6EfUJKgxzK7y8LqCmzSLC8), [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZoHxJMUiKOKPqu69vX3b_aeYGlDlRL6n)).


#### Day 2




Every member of the group should present an approximately an equal number of slides.

#### Day 3

You will be assigned a pair topic to research in more depth.


#### Day 4

Practice your pair topic, including a code challenge you will walk through during your presentation.


#### Day 5

All the groups will practice and then present their topics at the end of the day. Each presentation should be about 30 minutes long and include:

- Basics of each part of the topic
  - What makes the concept useful?
  - What are the unique properties of it? (Big O Notation, etc)
  - Example of a use case
- At least 5 visuals
- How to use the concept
- At least 10 images or videos
- A code exercise walkthrough
  - Show a code challenge and present your group's solution
- Additional resources
  - videos, code challenges, blogs that your group found helpful
- At least 3 code challenges for everyone to practice (at end of presentation and later)
  - After the presentation portion ends, give everyone 30 min to work on the first code challenge
  - Be available to answer questions on Zoom Q&A call
  - Have hints prepared for the first challenge to give, if needed
