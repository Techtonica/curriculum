## Data Structures and Algorithms

It is during the Data Structures and Algorithms Week that you will start to learn about data structures and algorithms, which are the core building blocks of all code.

## Expectations
**You are not expected to be experts on these topics by the end of the week**. This material is usually covered in 1-2 semesters of a Computer Science undergraduate degree. Almost all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms so having knowledge of these concepts will help you. We are starting this in advance so you are introduced to these concepts and can continue to practice in the coming weeeks.

## Teamwork
This sprint will also help you practice study skills, summarizing, teamwork, and presenting. You will be split into groups and assigned different topics to study and introduce in a presentation.

### Topics

All groups should review [Intro to Data Structures](../data-structures/intro-to-data-structures.md)

### Group A - Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists 
- [Stacks](../data-structures/stack.md)
- [Queues](../data-structures/queues.md)
- [Linked Lists](../data-structures/linked-lists.md)

### Group B - Trees ðŸŒ²
- [Trees](../data-structures/trees.md)
  - [Depth-First and Breadth-First Searches](../algorithms/searching.md#materials)
- Trees are everywhere (the DOM, your Filesystem)
- Trees are the No. 1 place you find recursion since they are by nature recursive. Every sub-tree is also a tree and its sub-tree is a tree...it's trees all the way down.

### Group C - Hash Tables (aka Map, HashMap, Dict, etc)
- [Hash Tables](../data-structures/hash-tables.md)

### Group D - Array Sorting/Searching
- [Array Sorting](../algorithms/sorting.md)
- [Linear & Binear Searching](../algorithms/searching.md#materials)


### Schedule

#### Day 1

In the morning, the Program Facilitator will give a quick introduction to data structures, split you into groups, and assign two data structures and three algorithms topics per group.The group members compare notes about topics, start creating introductory slides, and decide who will present what. groups will plan out demos, select beginner exercises and resources, polish slides, and practice presenting their introductory topic overviews (remember that reading is discouraged and eye contact and a loud, confident voice are encouraged).

Homework: read about your assigned data structures topics, highlight or outline the most important parts, and review runtime complexity ([topic outline](../runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md), [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZcOdekB_aP59huZdp4X0u6EfUJKgxzK7y8LqCmzSLC8), [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZoHxJMUiKOKPqu69vX3b_aeYGlDlRL6n)).
Groups will prepare introductory overviews to topics in this order:

1. Stacks
1. Queues
1. Linked lists
1. Hash tables
1. Trees

#### Day 2

All the groups will practice and then present the Data structure topics at the end of the day:

1. Stacks
1. Queues
1. Linked lists
1. Hash tables
1. Trees

#### Day 3

Prepare Algorithms:

- Intro to Algorithms
- Searching: Binary Search
- Searching: Depth First Search and Breadth First Search
- Sorting: Bubble Sort
- Sorting: Merge Sort
- Sorting: Quick Sort
- Sorting: Selection Sort and Insertion Sort

#### Day 4

All the groups will practice the algorithms and then present it at the end of the day.

### Introductory Overview Presentations Requirements

Presentations and exercises should be 40-45 minutes and must include:

- Google slides that give an overview
- A title slide
- The history of the concept
- A summary of what the concept is and why to use it
- How to use the concept
- At least 10 images or videos
- Big O notation and runtime details, if applicable
- Additional resources
- A code demo
- Several exercises for everyone to practice (at end of presentation and later)
- A slide about the presenters
