## Data Structures and Algorithms Sprint (2-3 Weeks)

Quick links: [Group Topics](#group-topics) | [Schedule](#schedule) | [Deliverables](#deliverables)

Data structures and algorithms are the core building blocks of all code. This sprint is expanded to span approximately 2-3 weeks, allowing each group to thoroughly work through all the DSA topics in sequence rather than just focusing on a single topic.

> Scope note: This curriculum is tailored for the 5-month cohort timeline, with the DSA sprint extended across multiple weeks to accommodate all topics.

## Expectations

**You are not expected to be experts on these topics immediately**. This material is usually covered in 1-2 semesters of a Computer Science undergraduate degree. Almost all technical interviews require knowledge of data structures and algorithms, so having a strong foundation in these concepts will significantly help your career prospects. We're introducing these concepts gradually to allow you time to practice and build expertise over several weeks.

> Scope note: This sprint is tailored for the 5-month cohort timeline. Material previously taught in month 6 is introduced in Week 11 here.

## Deliverables

### Group Presentation

Each group will deliver a ~30-minute presentation on their assigned topic. The presentation should include:

*   **Slides TL;DR:**
    *   ~30 minutes worth of slides (including solution walkthrough).
    *   5 code challenges:
        *   1 you walkthrough the solution of.
        *   1 you give the others time to start after your slides and are available for help.
        *   3 additional for others to practice - your group solves in advance and sends solutions to the SEAM.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Basics of each part of the topic:**
        *   What makes the concept useful?
        *   What are the unique properties of it? (Big O Notation, etc)
        *   Example of a use case.
    *   How to use the concept.
    *   At least 10 visuals (can be original or found on the internet).
    *   **A short code exercise walkthrough:**
        *   Show a code challenge and present your group's solution.
        *   Explain each line of code and how you came up with the solution.
        *   This can be done in VSCode (Google Slides does not highlight code well).
    *   **Additional resources slide at the end:**
        *   Include any videos, code challenges, or blogs that your group found helpful.
    *   **One post-slides code challenge:**
        *   After the presentation portion ends, give everyone 30 min to work on the first code challenge.
        *   In terms of difficulty, it should be solvable in <30min.
        *   Be available to answer questions on a Zoom Q&A call.
        *   Have hints prepared for the challenge to give, if needed.
    *   **An additional 3 code challenges for everyone to practice (at the end of the presentation and later):**
        *   Send solutions to all 3 from your group to the SEAM prior to your presentation.
        *   In terms of difficulty, they should take between 30-60min to solve.
        *   All other participants will have to choose one of yours to be homework over the weekend, to be turned into the SEAM.
