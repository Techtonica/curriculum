# JS + HTML Games

These are 3 possible games to make to practice using HTML and JS. They are listed easiest to hardest.

#### General guidelines for projects:
- Use GitHub Pages to serve the games
- Include a README with a demo, and instructions for how to run the code

## Games

### Coin Flip
Make a web page where you can flip a coin and it comes up heads 50% of times and tails 50% of times.

Extensions:
- Add a box where the user can say how many coins they want to flip. Then display that many coins and flip them all.

### Guess My Number
Make a web page that generates a random number and the user can guess the number until they get it right. 
For each guess, the game should display whether the answer is higher, lower, or correct.

Extensions:
- Track how many wrong guesses the user has made so far and display that count
- Track what numbers the user has already guessed and display those 

### Hangman
Make a web page where a random word is chosen from a list and displayed as blank spaces (one for each letter). 
The user needs to guess the letters in the word. Fill in the letters in the word as the user guesses them.
Count how many wrong letters the user has guessed.

Extensions:
- Give a hint for each word (e.g. "Animal" or "Food")
- Include multi-word phrases instead of just single words
- Let the user choose if they want an easy, medium, or hard word
