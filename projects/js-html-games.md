# JS + HTML Games

Make one or more of the 3 games listed easiest to hardest below to practice using HTML and JS. Feel free to work on whichever one(s) are a good challenge for you. It's up to you to decide how the site will look and the details of how it works. Be creative!

We have given you a few options, but you can do other games like tetris as long as you run them past us to make sure there aren't any issues (for example, we wouldn't want you to do something problematic like hangman).

Before you start think of everything that your page will do, plan out your HTML and JS before you get going!

### Project Requirements

- [ ] Make 1 or more games using JS and HTML
- [ ] Have at least 50 commits

- [ ] Perform math operations on numbers
- [ ] Increment and decrement variables
- [ ] Obtain a random number
- [ ] Find the length of a string
- [ ] Index into a string
- [ ] Create arrays using the proper syntax
- [ ] Create nested arrays
- [ ] Index into arrays
- [ ] Change data inside an array using index reassignment
- [ ] Change data inside an array using .push(), .pop(), .shift() and .unshift()
- [ ] Define a function using proper syntax
- [ ] Pass arguments into a function
- [ ] Understand the difference between global scope and local scope

- [ ] new Date(...arguments),
- [ ] Date.setTime()
- [ ] Use DOM methods to connect HTML and JS to create a game
- [ ] Include a README with a demo, and instructions for how to run the code
  - Pro-tip: CSS is not a requirement of this project, so it's smart to do the basics and focus on other curriculum unless you have extra time to practice design

### Optional Extension (not required)

- Use GitHub Pages to deploy and share your game website. You can follow [these instructions](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/f1-u3-github-pages) to deploy your code.

## Games

### Coin Flip

Make a web page where you can flip a coin and it comes up heads 50% of the time and tails the other 50%.

Optional Extension:

- Add a box where the user can say how many coins they want to flip. Then display that many coins and flip them all randomly.

### Guess My Number

Make a web page that generates a secret random number and the user can guess the number until they get it right.
For each guess, the game should display whether the answer is higher, lower, or correct.

Optional Extensions:

- Track how many wrong guesses the user has made so far and display that count
- Track what numbers the user has already guessed and display those
- Let the user choose the range of the secret number

### Boggle

Make a web page with [Boggle](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/boggle/specification.php)

Optional Extensions:

- Add a timer so that each person can only take a certain amount of time for a turn
- Advanced: Write a function that can [solve the boggle game](https://www.codewars.com/kata/boggle-solver/javascript) - find all the valid words using a dictionary
