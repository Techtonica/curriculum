# Assessment #9.5: Auth0

### Languages

- JS

### Tools

- Auth0

### Primary Goals

Demonstrate understanding of how to add oauth user authorization to a project with Auth0.

### Overview

In this project, you will add Auth0 to your jQuery/SQL version of Eventonica.

### Context

- This week you added Auth0 to your React/Enzyme/Mongo version of Eventonica. You have 2 hours to do the same with your earlier jQuery/SQL version of Eventonica.

### Basic Requirements

1. Your Auth0 secrets must be stored in an .env file.
2. You should make a new branch in your project called "auth" and add your new code there; you shouldn't have to worry about it messing up your main branch.
3. Push your final code (except the .env) up to GitHub, and send the repo URL to your Program Manager.
