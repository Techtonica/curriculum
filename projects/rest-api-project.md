# Project - Building a REST API with Node and Express in the BackEnd and DOM Manipulation in the FrontEnd

A RESTful API is an Application Programming Interface (API) that uses HTTP verbs like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE to operate dataâ€”also referred to as RESTful web services.

### Learning Objective:

What you will learn with this project is how to organize the data that comes from your backend using a REST API. At this moment, you don't know how to connect a DB, so for now, we will work with data in a JSON. (see the file [books.js](https://github.com/Yosolita1978/RESTAPI-mybooks/blob/main/restapi/books.js))

Don't be afraid of the terminology. A REST API it's just a way of organizing data according to the CRUD operations

## General guidelines for projects:

- In this project, you will build a REST API to manage books with Node.js and Express.
- You will use a simple JSON to store your books.
- Remember to start the project by creating your new branch in your assignments repo. By Friday, you should push your commit up to GitHub and have a PR ready to go for your partner.

## Specific guidelines for projects:

- Change the information inside the file books.js to have your data (`your books!`)
- Using Node and Express, create a GET router with a response that converts all your books using Json()
- Using that endpoint build a list of all your books in the frontend (client side). Note: you will need to make a GET request to bring all your information in the frontend too
- Using Node and Express, create a route for each one of the verbs in CRUD operations
- Using those endpoints allow the user to Delete a Book, Edit a Book, or Update a book from your original list

## Helping Resources:

- You can see how the first task in [Cristina's example](https://github.com/Yosolita1978/RESTAPI-mybooks/tree/main/restapi). This code only does a route for the initial GET and shows the list of her books
- [Here](https://stackabuse.com/building-a-rest-api-with-node-and-express/) is a good reading tutorial on how to work a REST API for your books.
  > Note: This tutorial uses XHttp request. Use [Fetch API](../project-example/week-6/rest-api-project/client/books-index.js) instead.
- [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8WPWK9mS5M&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery) is a good video tutorial on how to work a REST API for users

# Step by Step instructions - Building this from scratch

### For creating the server (using Express)

1. Make a new directory for your project.
2. cd into your new directory
3. create a package.json with the command `npm init y`
4. Make sure that the main file in your package is `index.js`
5. Install all the dependencies with the commands:`npm i express` and `npm i cors`
6. Install the module nodemon in the dev server with the command `npm i nodemon --save-dev`
7. Inside your package.json, change the scripts to:

```
"start": "node index.js",
"server": "nodemon index.js",
```

(doing this, you will delete the test script)

7. Create your index.js file (you can do that with `touch index.js` or directly on your VSCode)
