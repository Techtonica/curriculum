# Final Project

You did it! You learned all the pieces of the full stack and now it's time for you to put it all together to make an app of your own!

## Goals of the Final Project

In order of importance:

1. Demo in front of sponsor companies - memorable part of [your brand](../personal-brand/personal-branding.md)
1. Create something all your own (for your porfolio, to discuss in interviews)
1. Practice how to breakdown an idea into small, achievable chunks (a critical part of being an engineer)

### These are Explicitly _Not_ Goals of the Final Project
1. Prove you learned framework X, Y, Z (that's what the assessments are for)
1. To learn a new language or framework (although you can, this will eat into time to develop features)

# Process Outline

## Selection Phase
1. [Brainstorm ideas (quantity)](./selecting-your-project.md#idea-generation---alone)
1. Decide overall focus
1. Sift ideas (quality)
1. Refine two finalists
1. Write up pitch docs for two finalists
1. Discuss with mentor and SEAM
1. You decide finalist

## Inception Phase
1. User activities/flow
1. Risks - what if X doesn't work?
1. Prioritization - what is a must-have feature vs. nice-to-have
1. Plan out your 4 sprints (weeklong phases)

## Delivery Phase
1. Execute on your plan
1. Adapt to delays / changes
1. Ensure quality using automated tests

## Refinement Phase
1. Prepare demo
1. Deploy final version to the internet
1. Polish project README

## Prep Work

Before brainstorming ideas, it is helpful to think of your personal aim for the project, what is the most important aspect of it, unrelated to the problem your app solves.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

- What is your "specialty"? Do you love or hate CSS?
- What was your favorite technology to learn this cohort?
- What is something you _wanted to learn_ but we didn't cover?

## FAQ

#### Does my project have to be a PERN stack app?
Nope. It can be any type of software deliverable. In fact, choosing something else might make your project more memorable in demos because it wouldn't be "just another web app."

However, the reason we encourage sticking to the default PERN stack is that following that means you'll have a lot more tech help around you than you otherwise would. If you want to pursue an alternate tech stack, just make sure you have a bare minimum of **two committed tech mentors** (e.g. the SEAM and your mentor) that have enough experience in the stack to help if you get stuck (and time to meet with you).

#### The more buzzwords my app uses the better, right?
Definitely not! The more [shiny things](https://tstoaddicts.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/thehomer.png?w=538&h=456) you add into your app, the more time you'll spend learning about them and debugging them, rather than building actual features. Usually, simple is best. If in doubt, discuss the right balance with your mentor or the SEAM.
