# Final Project

You did it! You learned all the pieces of the full stack and now it's time for you to put it all together to make an app of your own!

## Goals of the Final Project

In order of importance:

1. Demo in front of sponsor companies - memorable part of [your brand](../personal-brand/personal-branding.md)
1. Create something all your own (for your porfolio, to discuss in interviews)
1. Practice how to breakdown an idea into small, achievable chunks (a critical part of being an engineer)

### These are Explicitly _Not_ Goals of the Final Project

1. Prove you learned framework X, Y, Z (that's what the assessments are for)
1. To learn a new language or framework (although you can, this will eat into time to develop features)

# Process Outline

## Selection Phase

1. [Brainstorm ideas (quantity)](./selecting-your-project.md#idea-generation---alone)
1. Decide overall focus
1. Sift ideas (quality)
1. Refine two finalists
1. Write up pitch docs for the finalist (see [example pitch doc](./example-pitch-doc.md))
1. Discuss with mentor and SEAM

## Inception Phase

1. User activities/flow
1. Risks - what if X doesn't work?
1. Prioritization - what is a must-have feature vs. nice-to-have
1. Plan out your 4 sprints (weeklong phases)

## Delivery Phase

1. Execute on your plan
1. Adapt to delays / changes
1. Break through technical challenges by seeking help, shifting your feature idea, etc

## Refinement Phase

1. Prepare demo
1. Deploy final version to the internet
1. Polish project README

## Prep Work

Before brainstorming ideas, it is helpful to think of your personal aim for the project, what is the most important aspect of it, unrelated to the problem your app solves.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

- What is your "specialty"? Do you love or hate CSS?
- What was your favorite technology to learn this cohort?
- What is something you _wanted to learn_ but we didn't cover?

## FAQ

#### Does my project have to be a PERN stack app?

Nope. It can be any type of software deliverable. In fact, choosing something else might make your project more memorable in demos because it wouldn't be "just another web app."

However, the reason we encourage sticking to the default PERN stack is that following that means you'll have a lot more tech help around you than you otherwise would. If you want to pursue an alternate tech stack, just make sure you have a bare minimum of **two committed tech mentors** (e.g. the SEAM and your mentor) that have enough experience in the stack to help if you get stuck (and time to meet with you).

#### The more buzzwords my app uses the better, right?

Definitely not! The more [shiny things](https://tstoaddicts.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/thehomer.png?w=538&h=456) you add into your app, the more time you'll spend learning about them and debugging them, rather than building actual features. Usually, simple is best. If in doubt, discuss the right balance with your mentor or the SEAM.

### Other Tips

- The goal is not to build a perfect app or company; questions about your app will be more about the process than the features.
- Projects are easiest when you've broken them down into the smallest tasks possible.
- Prioritize relentlessly.
- When you get stuck, first try to outline what you've done so far, what results you've gotten, and what exactly you're trying to do. If that doesn't help you come up with more things to try, show that outline to someone and ask for help.
- Beware of "feature creep." Don't let anyone pressure you to immediately add features beyond your MVP—thank them and maybe write down notes for "some day."
- Never push sensitive data (like API keys) to public repositories.
- Set deadlines for how long you have to get something working and stick to them.
- You can always learn more later—keep yourself from going too deep into a technology that isn't directly necessary for your MVP.
- Make a new branch with each week's changes and submit a pull request with any questions to simplify code reviews.
- Don't compare yourself to others. Don't be hard on yourself about not knowing everything yet. The important thing is to show you can learn.
- Make your UI purposefully basic and ugly at first so you can focus on features
- Commit your changes often and push to GitHub _at least_ a 4 times per day (10:00am, Lunch Break, 3:00pm, Before Wrap-up)—you should have at least 50 commits showing on your project day (closer to 200 is better) by the end of the project.
- Take care of yourself—take breaks, get sleep, eat three meals, drink enough liquids, etc.
- Check in with mentors, volunteers, other participants, and #tech-help often, and don't be afraid to ask someone while they're still helping someone else so they know you need help next.
