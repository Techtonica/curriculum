# Selecting Your Project

This is your chance to come up with pie-in-the-sky ideas including overly-ambitious projects. After you come up with your list, you'll pare it down, and likely simplify the goals to make it more approachable.

## Inspiration

- Reflect on your day-to-day: where do you see an opportunity for an optimization or an improvement?
  - An old product development trick is to observer users creating their own systems and then turning it into an app
  - For example, roommates might keep a shared doc of pantry items they run out of to use when grocery shopping - could this be a dedicated app?
- Current VC-funded apps tend to address the needs of wealthy white consumers with high disposable incomes so they can trade money for free time
  - Think of other markets more related to your and your family's life experiences
  - Who is not being served by current apps? What needs do they have that are different that the assumptions baked into current apps?
- What do you think about a lot? What adds friction to your life or those you see around you?
- Consider whether to make a feature into a standalone project. Look at some of your favorite apps, sites, or products. Can you re-purpose and improve upon one of its features?
- As a Techtonica participant...
  - What is a tool that could be useful for future participants?
- **Analyzing Data**
  - Is there a dataset you would love to dive into?
  - What questions do you have about your city or locale? Could data answer it?
  - [DataSF](https://datasf.org/) - hosts free data about the city
  - Many popular apps have APIs or offline anonymized datasets for student research

### Idea Generation - Alone

- Despite popular opinion, thinking alone produces [better ideas than group brainstorming](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/groupthink)
- Put yourself into FLOW MODE (mute slack, etc)
  - Using paper is likely best
- Review the above criteria
- Check out the sample idea list
- Set a 5 minute timer on your phone
  - Write down as many ideas as you can think of
  - Using paper may actually be better
  - Don't go into detail, just give them short names
- Use a new sheet of paper. Set another 5 minute timeer
  - Write down another set of ideas
- Repeat as needed until you have ~20 ideas
- Put them in a markdown doc - add some notes to each so someone else reading has a basic idea of what you meant
- Create a Gist and Slack URL to the Seam

### Idea Generation - Pair

- Review your pair's list from the solo exercise
- Synchronously in-person or over VC, set a strict **5 minute timer**
- Come up with more ideas
  - these can be variations of your pair's idea (Like your X but with Y)
  - they can be something that combines an idea from your list with an idea from your pair's list
  - they can also just be unrelated ideas
- After the 5 minutes, read them off and explain them
- Tell your pair which of their ideas is your favorite you'd most want to steal
- Create a Gist and Slack URL to the Seam

# Example Final Project Ideas

Many of these would be too large in scope for a final project, but hopefully they can help get your brainstorming hat humming and come up with your own.

## Examples in the World

- Look at some example projects:

  - [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/resources/coding-bootcamp-student-projects/)
  - [Hackbright](http://hackbrightacademy.com/student-projects/)

**For some inspiration, see [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) for lots of existing products of every shape and size.**

## Web Applications

- [LikeShop](https://likeshop.me/newyorkermag) clone - solves the Link in Bio problem. Make a simple MVP that Techtonica can use on their Instagram page
- Group chat app
- An app that helps a student learn a programming topic

## Plug-ins, Extensions of Existing Products

- Instead of /randomcoffee, make your own Pair Bot
- **Day Lead bot** - sends the Day Lead reminders to start stand-up/wrap-up, etc
- Build a browser extension to make a mini app inside the browser

## Hardware / Internet of Things IoT

- [📦 Time Qube](https://timeqube.com/) - a colored-light that is a subtle cue for speakers that they're running out of time
- Digital Pomodoro Timer - make a display of your current task
- [IoT Projects](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Internet-of-Things-Programming-Projects) - the companion for a book. Might be good to see some other ideas
