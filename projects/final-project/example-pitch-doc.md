# Example Final Project Pitch

## Elevator Pitch

_Short, 1-3 sentences about the project and why it matters to you._

Casual Care Pool is a way for neighbors to find pet owners in their neighborhood to swap pet care with. I'm building it because I have a hard time finding good swaps for my two unruly pomeranians.

## Technology

_What tools/framework will you use_

- CCP will be a mobile app so you can use it on the go and "friend" someone with their QR code if you meet IRL
- I will use React Native to build the UI
- the backend API will be PEN Postgres/Express/Node

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- User registration (you and your pet(s))
- Finding a pet owner in the DB
- Requesting a dog meet & greet

## Additional Nice-to-Have Features

- Show nearby pets on a map (Google Maps API??)
- QR code friending
- Scheduling care, integrating with Google Calendar
- Karma points to encourage helping others

## Technical Risks

_What might go wrong? (and how you'll adjust your plan if they do) - **Minimum 2**_

- React Native might be too complicated
  - In that case I will just build a response web app with regular React
- I run out of time on the owner & pet registration UI
  - I will simplify and just have the dog register but with human contact info (only one table, limit to single dog)
