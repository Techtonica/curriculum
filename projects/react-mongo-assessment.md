## Project Instructions
-----

#### MongoDB & Mongoose

- [ ] Add an "about" field to your existing User documents.
- [ ] Add some "about" text to any fake users.
- [ ] Be sure to consider the new "about" field in your Mongoose schema and API endpoints to include the field for new Users. 

-----

#### React & Enzyme

- [ ] Show and style your new "about" data somewhere in the UI with other User data.
- [ ] Add shallow and mount testing with Enzyme and Jest for your new elements.

-----

#### Security

- [ ] Use DOMPurify in your searchbar to prevent XSS
- [ ] Validate user input for a project with Parsley and validate fields with Validator.

-----

#### Submit your project

- [ ] Your project must run. Note any updates to run instructions in your branch's README.md.
- [ ] Do not merge "about" to your master branch.  Push up your final changes, and send the url of your updated project to your Program Manager.
