# Intro to Eventonica

Welcome to the Eventonica project!

> Note: as of Summer 2021, we will be jumping straight into [eventonica-react](../eventonica-react/README.md).  Please go to there unless you know you want to follow these Vanilla JS Eventonica outlines instead.

In this project, you'll make a web app to manage events.

You'll work on this project over the next several weeks. The features will remain the same but as you learn more libraries and techniques, you'll integrate those into the app. By the end you'll have built a full-stack web app with React and a database.

## Project Requirements

### Events

- Add a new Event
  - The attributes are up to you. Look through all the features and see what an Event needs
- Delete an Event

### Search Events

- Search for events by date
- Search for events by category

### Users

- Add a new User
- Delete a User

### Favorite Events

- A User can **favorite** an Event
- A User can **unfavorite** an Event
- A User can view their list of previously favorite events

### Optional Bonus Requirements

- Update existing Event
