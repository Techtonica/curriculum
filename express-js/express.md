# Express.js

### Projected Time
4 hours, including lab exercise

### Prerequisites
- [How the Internet Works](../requests-and-responses/requests-and-responses.md)
- [Node.js](../node-js/node-js.md)

### Motivation
- Express.js is one part of the MERN web development stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), we cover at Techtonica. Express.js allows you to quickly build a website served by Node.js.
- Express enables robust routing and improve performance.
- It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) which can be directly plugged into Express.

### Objectives

**Participants will be able to:**
- Explain the MVC framework
- Create a basic web app using Node.js for the server and Express.js as the MVC framework

### Specific Things to Learn
- What Express.js is
- What middleware is
- How to code a very simple web app using Express.js
- MVC framework
  - Model
  - View
  - Controller

### Materials
- [Express.js slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12h5SyQO7yk-cepXk_t5o-5zvXLGAOUFU-Ui7U5ZLDcY/edit?usp=sharing)


### Lesson
- Read through lesson slides [Express.js](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12h5SyQO7yk-cepXk_t5o-5zvXLGAOUFU-Ui7U5ZLDcY/edit?usp=sharing)
- Video walkthrough of lesson slides [Express.js](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F-mQpSktXY4EETO4urrVrPuepE_1p-m6/view?usp=sharing)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- Express.js is a web framework; Node.js is a server (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-web-server-and-a-web-framework)
- Express.js code goes inside your app.js file
- You must use an object-relational mapper (ORM) for Express.js to be a true MVC framework

### Independent Practice
[Express.js lab exercise](/express-js/express-lab-exercise.md)

### Challenge
Apprentices can expand their skills in Express.js by finding tutorials online showing how to implement additional features not shown in class, such as login/logout, shopping cart, blog posts or photo galleries.

### Check for Understanding
Apprentices can create a list, in their own words, of the steps they went through during the lab exercise to create a basic Express.js web app. They will refer to this list in future Techtonica and personal projects.
