# Coding Interviews

### Prerequisites

📽️ Watch this video of [How to Tackle the Coding Interview](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nb34vrf0tb99goi/video1554065253.mp4?dl=0)

This section should be used as additional material after you have already gone through the following curriculum:

- [algorithms](../algorithms/intro-to-algorithms.md)
- [data-structures](../data-structures/intro-to-data-structures.md)

Advisory Board Member Krys Flores wrote an entire page on her website about who to approach coding problems. We recommend reading it as a starting place. [Click here to read.](https://krysflores.com/coding-interviews)

## Projected Time

_Varies_

## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Leetcode Style Problems

Yes, sometimes you have to do leetcode problems. Almost no one thinks they're fun. Now that you've realized you have to look at Leetcode problems, you can get easily overwhelmed when you go to the Leetcode website. Don't randomly pick exercises. Instead, use [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) to curate a list for you based on the amount of time you want to spend studying.

### Good Youtube Videos
