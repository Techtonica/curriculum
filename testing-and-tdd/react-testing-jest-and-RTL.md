# Testing React Components with Jest and React Testing Library

### Projected Time

~ 2 hours

### Prerequisites

Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson:

- [Intro to Testing and TDD](testing-and-tdd.md)
- [Intro to Jest](jest.md)

### Motivation

Learn a commonly used React testing tool.

Jest is designed to test JS and React code.  React Testing Library (RTL) is a great tool to use with Jest to test that your component is rendering and behaving as expected from the perspective of the user, as opposed to the perspective of the developer.  The idea is that the most critical things that you don't want to break are the experience of the end user - for example, do you want a test for a button to fail when its internal function name changes or gets refactored?  It's probably more important that the component renders at all, that it renders with the right styles, and it behaves correctly when clicked.
