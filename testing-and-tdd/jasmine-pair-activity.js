/*
Take this source file as a starting point and copy it into a new folder in your personal assignments repo.

Implement a function called invert.

Creates an object composed of the inverted keys and values of object. If object contains duplicate values, subsequent values overwrite property assignments of previous values.

let object = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1 };
 
invert(object);
// => { '1': 'c', '2': 'b' }

Implement this function and then create Jasmine tests to verify its 
correctness. Think of all the input that could come in and decide
what to do with them via tests.
